Forest cover in the 16-ha study area(T143N. R36W. Sec. 36. N?. NE?; pine?maple/BuddLake area of Webb [1988. 1989]) is heterogeneous withelements of northern hardwoods. white pine. red pine.and aspen?sugar maple cover types (Eyre 1980). Clustersof Pinus resinosa and scattered individual Pinusstrobus amidst hardwoods date back over 250 yr basedon our tree ring counts and originated after fire (Frissell1973; Clark 1989). The understory is also heterogenous.with thickets of Corylus cornuta shrubs. clumpsof the shrub Acer spicatum. carpets of seedlings of Acersaccharum and Acer rubrum. and patches of saplingsof Ostrya virginiana and Acer saccharum. The herbaceousflora is sparse and thus omitted from this analysis.Nomenclature follows Gleason and Cronquist 1991.METHODSPlots were sampled in mid-summer 1984. 1992. and1996. Each treefall had four 2 3 2 m plots: one plotnear the base (0.5 m north of the stump?s north edge).one plot in the fallen crown area (north of the bole justbeyond the first branch of the fallen crown). and twocontrol plots in parallel configuration at undamagedconspecific trees. Two base plots and three crown plotswere omitted due to interference from trails or treelesswet meadows. Note that plot locations were not permanentlymarked in the original survey. Thus. althoughthe treefall plots were likely to coincide in repeatedsampling. the control plots were less likely to be placedin exactly the same location in subsequent surveys. Ineach plot. all trees and shrubs were identified. counted.and recorded by height class (small. .50 cm in height;medium. 50-200 cm; tall. .200 cm in height. but dbh. 2.5 cm). Of 30 treefalls sampled originally in 1984.17 were still distinguishable in 1992. and 11 were distinguishablein 1996. In some cases. we are certain thatwe found the location of the old treefall. but the primarywindthrown tree had been obliterated by subsequenttreefalls. or (particularly for Betula papyrifera)entirely decomposed. Windthrown pines were still visibleand were all relocated. In contrast. fallen Populustremuloides. P. grandidentata. and other hardwoodswere less persistent. Any resulting bias in plot retrievalshould exaggerate the effects of windstorms. since largertreefalls were most likely to be included in the latersurveys. To accommodate decreasing sample size overtime. comparisons are based on densities per unit area.The data set contained a total of 58 individual plots in1984 and 1992. and 40 plots in 1996. Sample size wassufficient to reveal significant changes over time in thestatistical analysis; thus differences between treefalland control areas should also be detectable.We used repeated-measures ANOVA to identify differencesin vegetation that might be related to windstormdisturbance. The dependent variables. run one ata time. were species richness overall. for shrubs. andfor trees; and stem density by height class for all woodystems combined. for all shrubs. for all trees. and byspecies. The three independent variables. modeled together.were (1) treefall vs. control plot. (2) base vs.crown plot. and (3) year (1984. 1992. 1996). The base/crown factor was not significant and is not discussedhere. For those species for which ??year?? was significant.we checked for carry-over effects using a test forsphericity. In cases where the sphericity assumption ofthe univariate model was violated (the case of P .0.05). we tested again using a multivariate test that wasless powerful but more conservative (von Ende 1993;Norusis 1993).

West Thornton. Grafton County. New Hampshire. USA. Our study took place on the 10-ha forest plot de- scribed by Holmes and Sturges (1975). which is located on a relatively steep (20-25%). south-southeast facing slope at an elevation of 500 to 600 m and adjacent to the lower third of watershed 6. the reference area for many of the Hubbard Brook ecosystem studies. The study plot was situated within a large tract of unfrag- mented and relatively homogeneous northern hard- woods forest. > 5 km distant from. and at an elevation 300 m above. the nearest human settlement. The only human-caused disturbances near the study area were on three experimental watersheds. 13. 10. and 22 ha in extent. which were logged by clear-cutting in 1967. in 1970. and from 1973 to 1975. respectively. The nearest of these was 0.6 km from the edge of our plot. the others were 1 and 2 km away. Although some for- est-dwelling birds moved to these areas in mid and late summer to feed on ripening fruit. we have no evidence that birds settling and breeding on the study area were in any way affected by these logged areas.Bird populations Bird censuses were conducted in a consistent manner in each of the 16 summers. These census methods have been described in detail by Holmes and Sturges (1975). Briefly. they involved: (1) Timed censuses. Two ob- servers moved at a rate of 50 m/6 min along parallel transect lines. 1 00 m apart. and recorded all birds heard or seen within 50 m on either side of the line. Since the 10-ha plot was 500 m long and 200 m wide and these lines ran 50 m in from the long sides. the entire plot was surveyed in a 1-h census. From these records. the numbers of individuals observed on the plot were then tallied. A minimum of two such censuses was conducted each week from late May through mid-July. (2) Territory-mapping. The positions of individual males (and females when seen). especially those en- gaged in simultaneous singing with neighbors. were plotted on a gridded census map. From these records. the territories of the males of many species could be delineated. (3) Mist-net captures. Forty to 50 mist nets. located at 50-m intervals on the census grid. were op- erated for 6-8 h/d. usually 1 or 2 d/wk from late May through early July in all years except 1980. Each cap- tured bird was given an aluminum band plus a unique combination of colored plastic bands. Capture and re- capture frequencies provided additional information on the presence of birds on the plot. including females and occasionally floaters. (4) Detailed observations. These provided information on nesting events and on the occurrence of females associated with males. Data from all methods were pooled and used to es- timate the total numbers of adult birds of each species living on the 1 0-ha study area during the breeding pe- riod. late May to early July. Final density estimates were adjusted for territories occurring only partly on the plot (i.e.. if a territory of a mated pair was half off the study area. only 0.5 male and 0.5 female for a total of one bird was counted) and for unmated males. The data therefore represent the total numbers of adult in- dividuals occupying 10 ha of northern hardwoods. For comparisons with most other studies. the numbers of individuals estimated to be on our plot should be di- vided in half to approximate the numbers of breeding pairs. These methods were most efficient for estimating the numbers of relatively small. mostly passerine birds that inhabit these forests. but also most woodpeckers and the one hummingbird species (see Table 2). We were unable to census adequately the raptors (Red-tailed Hawk. Buteo jamaicensis; Broad-winged Hawk. B. platypterus; Sharp-shinned Hawk. Accipiterstriatus; and Barred Owl. Strix varia). Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa um- bellus). Chimney Swift (Chaetura pelagica). and Pi- leated Woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus). which were present in this forest but ranged over an area much larger than our 10-ha plot. These low-density species are not included in our analyses. Insect Sampling We used two methods to estimate the abundance of larval Lepidoptera (caterpillars). First. during periods of relatively high caterpillar densities (specifically sum- mers 1969 through 1973). we collected their fecal pel- lets (frass) falling from the forest canopy. Following the procedures of Gosz et al. (1973). we placed 20 funnels (each 20 cm in diameter) lined with filter paper and attached to 1 m tall stakes in a rectangular array on the census plot. with adjacent funnels 100 m apart. Frass was collected from the funnels at 2-4 d intervals. dried at 70'C for 48 h. and then weighed. Second. in 10 summers. caterpillars were censused directly on foliage by visually searching at least 80 50- leaf samples (i.e.. 4000 leaves and supporting petioles and twigs) at z2-wk intervals. For this paper. only data from caterpillar counts on beech foliage in the forest understory are presented. because (1) it was cen- sused in more seasons than any other type of foliage. (2) caterpillar abundance there was representative of that occurring on the foliage of other forest trees (R. T. Holmes and J. C. Schultz. personal observation). and analyses of the vertical distribution of caterpillars in this forest showed few if any differences in their abundance among the canopy. subcanopy. and sapling strata (J. C. Schultz and R. T. Holmes. personal ob- servation). Foliage profile measurements For recording changes in the vertical distribution of foliage. we measured the foliage density profile. using the method of MacArthur and Horn (1969). Six sep- arate vertical transects were made along a randomly placed sample line at each of 20 sites located 100 m apart on the study area. The measurements were av- eraged for each site. and then means and standard de- viations of foliage densities at each of seven vertical strata were obtained for the plot as a whole. Data were taken on the plot in 1972-1973 and again in 1982 at the same locations. Student's t tests were used to detect differences in foliage density within each stratum be- tween sampling periods.

The abundances of all mobile taxa of fishes (Scarids. Labrids. Acanthurids. Serranids. etc.) observed on on a five by fifty meter transect which extends from the bottom to the surface of the water column are recorded by a diver using SCUBA. The diver then swims back along a one by fifty meter section of the original transect line and records the abundances of all non-mobile or cryptic taxa of fishes (Pomacentids. Gobiids. Cirrhitids. Holocentrids etc). Surveys are conducted between 0900 and 1600 hours (Moorea local time) during late July or early August each year. In 2006. divers also began to estimate the size (length) of each fish observed to the nearest half cm. Four replicate transects are surveyed in each of six locations on the forereef (two on each of Moorea's three sides). six locations on the backreef (two on each of Moorea's three sides) and on six locations on the fringing reef (two on each of Moorea's three sides) for a total of 72 individual transects. Transects are permanently marked using a series of small. stainless steel posts affixed to the reef. Transects on the forereef are located at a depth of approximately 15m. those on the backreef are located at a depth of approximately 1.5m and those on the fringing reef are located at a depth of approximately 10m.LocationsAnnual fish census locations are labeled with four components in a stratified design: 6 sites. 3 habitats. 4 transects. 2 swaths. (The swaths are the transect widths of 1 m and 5 m.) Therefore there are 144 unique locations surveyed each year. The six MCR-LTER sites span the three shores of the roughly triangular island of Moorea with Sites 1 and 2 on the north-facing shore. Sites 3 and 4 on the south-east-facing shore. and Sites 5 and 6 on the south-west-facing shore. At each site. the three habitats are the Fringing Reef. Backreef. and Forereef. At each habitat. there are four transects. Each transect has two swaths. The two swaths are described in the Diver Observation method step.Dive ConditionsIn addition to the biotic data collected. divers also record data on the date and time each transect was surveyed. wind speed and sea state. swell height in m. amount of cloud cover in % and horizontal visibility in m. Dive conditions are recorded for each dive. which is unique to a habitat at a site for a year. Therefore there are 18 unique dive conditions each year (3 habitats at 6 sites).DiversAt each site. at each habitat. there are four transects. each covered by an assigned diver (in 2005 by 2 divers). Whenever possible. the same diver covers the same transect number every year. (Transect 3 has varied.) The diver is listed by their initials. (In 2005. the initials of 2 divers are concatenated.) The diver ID is determined by the year and transect number; there are 4 unique diver IDs for each year.Reference for fish census protocolThe MCR-LTER annual fish census is based on the 'Fish Belt Transect' method described in: 'Methods for Ecological Monitoring Of Coral Reefs: A Resource For Managers.

Lockley. He took a lease on the island in October1927. and kept records of breeding birds from 1928 to1940 (Lockley 1938. 1947). After the war theobservatory was run by the West Wales Field Societyand the Council for the Promotion of Field Studies (nowthe Field Studies Council). and later by the EdwardGrey Institute of Field Ornithology of the University ofOxford. Records of breeding and. for most species inmost years. counts or estimates of the numbers ofbreeding pairs are available from 1928 to 1979. with abreak from 1941 to 1945. making 47 years of records.Those up to 1967 have been published by Lack (1969)and analysed by Williamson (1981). Those since 1967have been extracted from the Annual Reports of theObservatory in the Alexander Library of the EdwardGrey Institute. The whole record for land and waterbirds is given in Tab. 1.The criterion for inclusion in Tab. 1 is breeding. butas is now well recognised. there are different degrees ofcertainty in such records. For a study of immigrationand extinction the important question is whether a pairof birds was attempting to breed. rather than whether itbred successfully. For instance the raven Corvus coraxhad one pair every year (two in 1961). but in 1978built a nest in Steep Bay. but it remained empty. Inthe British Trust for Ornithology code this is B. Nestbuilding. and counts only as Probable breeding in thisspecies. though it is regarded as Confirmed breedingin most others (Sharrock 1976). For this study it countsas a population of one pair. In most cases the annualreport gives a single figure for the number of pairs. Forneighbouring integers. e.g. 12 or 13. I have taken thehigher figure. for ranges. e.g. 35 to 40. a figure at or just slightly from Lack (1969). and includes figures thatabove the mid-point (38 in this case). Lack records as question marks. and Lockley also givesFor the pre-war figures Lockley (1947) differs the figures for 1940. I have therefore taken histhroughout. rather than Lack's. The only importantdifference in relation to the MacArthur-Wilson theoryis that Lockley records one pair of sky lark Alauda arvensisin 1938. which Lack (and Williamson 1981) recordas an extinction followed by an immigration in1939. Lockley also notes that he shot or deported littleowls Athene noctua when he could. because they atestorm petrels Hydrobates pelagicus. so I have excludedlittle owls from Tab. 1.It is evident that many of the estimates of the commonbirds in Tab. 1 are round figures. In some yearsestimates are lacking. though breeding is recorded. andas a full set of figures is needed for the calculations thatfollow I have interpolated. approximately linearly. insuch cases. The interpolated figures are in italics in Tab.1.Skokholm is a most important station for sea-birdpopulations. Throughout the years there have beenthousands of pairs of Manx shearwater Puffinus puffinus.storm petrel Hydrobates pelagicus. and puffinsFratercula arctica. and these are the largest colonies.along with those on the neighbouring island of Skomer.in the Celtic Sea (Cramp et al. 1974). Herring gullsLarus argentatus and lesser black-backed gulls Larusfuscus have increased from hundreds of pairs pre-war tothousands now. There are also hundreds of pairs ofrazorbills Alca torda and guillemots Uria aalge. Thegreat black-backed gull Larus marinus population iscontrolled at around ten pairs. The fulmar Fulmarusglacialis first bred in 1967 and even now occupies lessthan twenty sites. There have been casual records ofbreeding of shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis and kittiwakeRissa tridactyla (Lockley 1969). There have also beenthirty to forty pairs of rock pipits Anthus spinolettabreeding on the cliffs each year. Lack (1969) did notregard them as land-birds. and I have. somewhat reluctantly.followed him. partly because the estimates ofpopulation size are even rougher than those of themeadow pipit A. pratensis.MethodsMany features of the data can be brought out by simplemethods (Williamson 1981). However. to produce asatisfactory ordination of both species and years is notso simple. and requires a consideration both of differentordination methods. and of whether the data should betransformed.For most biological populations a transformation tothe logarithm of the numbers is desirable (Williamson1972a). When there are many zeros. as in Tab. 1. log(n+1) or better the arc-sinh transformation. which islog (n+(n2+ 1)12). can be used (Williamson 1981). butthese small numbers show features of a Poisson distribution.s o a square root transformation may be desirable(Pollard 1977). Tukey (1977) gives methods fordetermining an appropriate power transformation.which he refers to as re-expression. (with the logarithmbeing equivalent to a zero power). It is well-known thata plot of the logarithm of the mean against thelogarithm of the variance may indicate that a transformation is needed. When the variance is proportional tothe mean. a square root transformation is indicated; thestandard deviation proportional to the mean indicates alogarithmic transformation. Taylor et al. (1978) givemany examples of such plots showing clearly. to mymind. that most biological data needs transformationand usually something. on Tukey's scale. bounded bythe square root and the logarithm.These tests on the data of years in Tab. 1. both includingand excluding zeros. point to a square roottransformation. By species. again with and withoutzeros. the results are more variable. which is not surprising.The raven population is almost constant at onepair. The stock dove Columba oenas and jackdaw Corvusmonedula populations vary from zero to sixty pairs.In view of this scatter.although a logarithmic transformationwould be better for the common species. asquare root transformation is justifiable for all. and sohas been used.A standard Principal Component Analysis of datawith many zeros usually produces a curved result. thehorseshoe effect. from artificial data designed to belinear (Williamson 1978). Various methods have beenproposed to prevent this including multi-dimensionalscaling. MDS (Carroll and Arabie 1980). reciprocal averaging(or contingency analysis). and Hill's developmentof it. Decorana (Gauch 1982). and the step-acrossmethod (Williamson 1978). Reciprocal averaging andstep-across are direct; multi-dimensional scaling isiterative. and requires a variety of starting configurations.Decorana assumes the second Principal axis to bean artefact. and reduces it by a slicing technique.Step-across applies only to incidence matrices. whereall the entries are one of zero. Much of the variation inTab. 1 and similar data occurs in the number of entitiespresent. The similarity index used in step-across is theJaccard one. the number of joint occurrences. Thenatural extension of this to continuous data is illustratedin Fig. 2. It is the total set of joint occurrences. the areaof the intersection of the species graphs. Mathematically.this is Kendall's (1971) circle product. I min (a.b). The effect of using the circle product on species withmoderate overlap is to make them more similar than ifthe Jaccard index is used. so tending to re-create ahorseshoe. This can be corrected by a transformation;the square root of the circle product has been used here.This development of step-across can be called stepalongfor convenience.English (1982) compared MDS. Decorana andstep-along analyses of both the Eastern Wood (Williamson1981) data and a sub-set of the Skokholm data.using years in which complete records exist. Not allvariants of MDS are available at York. but he foundthose that were very expensive in computer time. requiring arbitrary choices of starting point. and the resultsdisappointing. Decorana produced the straightesttime axis. but. as will be seen. the time axis at Skokholmshould be curved. So the method has had the unfortunateeffect of removing. as an artefact. a real feature.The species ordination by Decorana was not readily interpretable.Consequently. the remainder of this paperdeals only with step-along results.

In 1952 inmixed prairie near Redvers. Saskatchewan. and in 1953in aspen-parkland near Lousana. Alberta (Fig. 1). theUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service undertookyearly collections of waterfowl census and habitat dataon 0.2 km wide. permanently established transects. TheRedvers Waterfowl Study Area was a reversed-L transect.each arm roughly 32.2 km long; the total areawas 12.9 km2. The terrain was gently rolling and reliefgenerally <3 m. The pothole basins were generallysaucer shaped rather than bowl shaped (Stoudt 1971).The Lousana Waterfowl Study Area was a rectangulartransect roughly 16.1 x 6.4 km. or 9.3 km2. The terrainwas knob-and-kettle-like. A larger percentage ofponds at Lousana. compared with Redvers (45 vs.31%). were classified as permanent (Smith 1971).Each pothole on the transects was numbered andvisited several times yearly when breeding pairs of allspecies were counted. Dzubin (1969a) provided a reviewof the potential biases in transect-collected censusdata for ducks. Violations of these assumptionspose problems for deterministic calculations; the valuein these data is that. while they may be crude by thosestandards. the amount of data and the time span theycover outweigh disadvantages imposed by the mannerof data collection. Two assumptions. for purposes ofthis analysis. are important: first. the relative populationsizes of ducks were as the observers recordedthem. and second. proportional use of different pondtypes by different species was represented by the censusdata. The second assumption is made more plausibleby validation of the first; the first is reasonablebecause considerable effort was made to census allponds thoroughly (Smith 1971:14. Stoudt 1971:14). Onebiologist collected most of the data. although in recentyears. other United States Fish and Wildlife Servicepersonnel and I collected data.Each pothole was scored for each of the followingcharacteristics: permanence classification. size.depth. degree of openness of surrounding vegetation.percent coverage of pond surface by emergentvegetation. and type of vegetation. All values of habitatvariables were of ordinal level; type of vegetationwas not a nominal-level variable because it tookon values that corresponded to structural complexity(height. density) of each plant type or association.Twenty-six years of data (1952-1977) from Redverswere available for analysis. Four censuses were conductedyearly from 1952 to 1965; commencement datesof censuses varied between 1-11 May. 1-4 June. 29June-13 July. and 22-26 July. Eight and six censuseswere conducted in the drought years 1961 and 1962.respectively. After 1965. one July census was begunbetween 11 and 23 July; dates of May and June censusesvaried as in previous years. Nine years (1968-1976) of data from the Lousana area were availablefor analysis.

The method makes useof concepts from distance sampling. i.e.. point countsor line-intercept techniques. The method makes noattempts to model capture-history data. therefore it wasnot necessary to follow individuals through time(between sessions). Distance sampling methods allow forsighting or detection (capture) probabilities todecrease with increasing distance from the point orline. The modeling of detection probability as afunction of distance forms the basis for estimation.Trapping webs were designed to provide a gradient ofcapture probabilities. decreasing with distance from theweb center. Density estimation from the trapping web wasbased on three assumptions:1. All animals located at the center of the webwere caught with probability 1.0;2. Individuals did not move preferentially towardor away from the web center;3. Distances from the web center to each trapstation were measured accurately.Each web consisted of 12 trap lines radiating around acenter station. each line with 12 permanently-markedtrap stations. In order to increase the odds ofcapturing any animals inhabiting the center of a web.the center station had four traps. each pointing in acardinal direction. and the first four stations of eachtrap line were spaced only 5 m apart. providing a trapsaturation effect. The remaining eight stations in atrap line were spaced at 10 m intervals. The web thusestablished a series of concentric rings of traps. Trapsin the ring nearest the web center are close together.while the distances separating traps that form aparticular ring increase with increasing distance of thering from the web center. The idea is that the webconfiguration produces a gradient in trap density and.therefore. in the probability of capture. Three randomlydistributed trapping webs were constructed at each site.The perimeters of webs were placed at least 100 m apartin order to minimize homerange overlap for individualscaptured in the outer portion of neighboring webs.Measurement TechniquesEach site containing three webs was sampled for threeconsecutive nights during spring (in mid May or earlyJune) and summer (in mid July or early August for years1989 to 1993. then mid September to early October foryears 1994 through 2000). In that rodent populationswere not sampled monthly over the study period. there isno certainly that either spring or summer trapping timesactually captured annual population highs or lows. Basedon reproductive data in the literature. an assumptionwas made that sampling times chosen represent periods ofthe year when rodents have undergone. and wouldregister. significant seasonal change in density.During each trapping session. one Sherman live trap(model XLF15 or SFAL. H. B. Sherman Traps. Tallahassee.FL) was placed. baited with rolled oats. and set at eachpermanent. numbered station (four in the center) on eachweb. for a total 444 traps over three webs. Traps werechecked at dawn each day. closed during the day. andreset just before dusk. Habitat. trap station number.species. sex. age (adult or juvenile). mass. bodymeasurements (total length. tail length. hind footlength. ear length). and reproductive condition (males:scrotal or non-scrotal; females: lactating. vaginal orpregnant) were recorded for each initial capture of anindividual. Each animal was marked on the belly with apermanent ink felt pen in order to distinguish it fromother individuals during the same trapping session. Thetrap station number for an initial capture related to aparticular trapping ring on a web and. therefore. to aparticular distance from the center of the web. The areasampled by a ring of traps was computed based oncircular zones whose limits are defined by pointshalfway between adjacent traps along trap lines; anadditional 25 m radius was added to the outer ring oftraps in order to account for homerange size ofindividuals caught on the outer ring.Analytical ProceduresArea trapped and number of individuals caught for eachring of traps was the basis for estimating theprobability density function of the area sampled. Theprogram DISTANCE produced the estimators used tocalculate density. Where sample size for a particularspecies and web was less than an arbitrarily chosenn=10. the number of individuals captured during thatsession was simply divided into the area of the web plusthe additional 25 m radius (4.9087 ha).

Site descriptionWithin the 20 ha study area there are 24 experimental plots. Each plot has anarea of 0.25 ha and is fenced to regulate rodent access to the plot. Access is regulated using gatescut into the fencing. Large gates (3.7 ? 5.7 cm) allow all small mammals to access plots. Smallgates (1.9 ? 1.9 cm) exclude kangaroo rats (Dipodomys) whose inflated auditory bullae make theirskulls too large to pass through the gates. Rodent removal plots do not contain any gates andanimals caught on those plots are removed and released outside the cattle exclosure fence.On each plot there are 49 permanent trapping stations marked by rebar stakes forming a 7 ? 7 grid.Every stake on a plot has a unique identifying number denoting the coordinate of that stake on thatplot. For example. stake 11 is the first stake on the first row. Rows are numbered 1 through 7going from the most northern row to the most southern. Columns are numbered 1 through 7 goingfrom the most western column to the most eastern (See metadata.htm. Fig. 1).Treatments: See metadata.htm. Table 1. for details on treatment assignments for each plot.Data Collection Period. Frequency: From 1977?2002. plots were trapped around each newmoon ? which occurs approximately once a month. though occasionally blue moons do occur.resulting in 2 separate surveys in a month. Occasionally. months are missed. Months that areentirely missed are not noted in the database. Sometimes weather or other unforeseen occurrencesprevent the complete trapping of a survey. these are noted in the database (see Table 1 below).3. Research MethodsField: The site is surveyed for rodents approximately once each month. The survey occurs asclose to the new moon as possible to minimize external effects on trapping success which could bemisconstrued as actual changes in populations. During a survey. each plot is trapped for one nightwith treatments divided evenly between nights to eliminate differences between controls andtreatments caused by environmental differences on different nights. When a plot is surveyed. allgates are closed to ensure that only resident individuals are captured. At each stake. one Shermanlive-trap is placed and baited with millet seed. Traps are collected the next morning andindividuals processed. Each individual was tagged and data on species. location caught (plot andstake). sex. reproductive condition. weight. and hindfoot length were recorded. Until 1993.individuals were tagged using either ear tags or toe tags. After 1993. individuals werepredominately tagged using Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) Tags.

For the presentation and thepreprocessing of the species data. logarithmic values of the carbon content ofeach species population per sampling date were calculated and plottedsymmetrically as kite diagrams along the horizontal (time) axis (Figures 4 and 5).Kite diagrams. first constructed by Lohmann (1908). are still considered topresent adequately phytoplankton species assemblages and succession (cf. Reidet al.. 1985). In these diagrams time is the horizontal axis. Species are arrangedvertically in a sequence that approximates their seasonal succession. Thissequence was derived from the divisive hierarchical clustering method TWINSPAN(Hill. 1979a). which performs a simultaneous ordering of samples and species.A number of diatoms and flagellates was not identified to species level anddiffered in dimensions.

Asynthesis of the anchovy spawning areas. larvae and juvenile distribution. and hypothesesabout recruitment mechanisms can be found in Irigoien et al (2007). Stations were locatedevery 3 nautical miles (nm) along transects 15 nm apart perpendicular to the coast. Avertical plankton haul was made at each sampling station. using a 150?m PairoVET net (2-CalVET nets. Smith et al.. 1985). The net was lowered to a maximum depth of 100 m or 5m above the bottom at shallower stations. Samples were preserved in 4% formaldehydebuffered with sodium tetraborate. Samples were stored in 150 ml jars. The sample wasthoroughly mixed in a measuring cylinder. the total volume measured (usually around 150ml) and an aliquot of 6 ml was taken with a pipette from each sample. The average numberof organisms counted in each plate with this sub sampling set up is around 400 individuals.The aliquot was stained for 24 hours with 4 ml 1% eosin. which stains the cell cytoplasmand the muscle protein. This stain creates sufficient contrast to be recognised by imageanalysis and reduces counting of detrital material. The sub-samples were scanned onpolystyrene plates (12.7 x 8.5 cm) in 24 bit colour. at a resolution of 600 dpi using an HPScanjet8200 series scanner (reflective). The samples were not manually separated.Preliminary work (unpublished) has shown that as long as the percentage of the imagecovered by the sample remains below 3 % there is a linear relation between the number ofitems and the automatic counting. Over that threshold the percentage of organisms touchingeach other increases and results in an underestimation of the abundance. For samples fromthe Bay of Biscay the aliquot taken and the plastic plate size assures that this limit is notreached. These images were analyzed using Zooimage (www.sciviews.org/zooimage). Atotal of 17 classes were selected combining expert opinion and the class selection methodproposed by Fernandes et al. (2008).

Department of Fisheries and Environment atWhitehorse. Yukon Territory.In 1975 a Petterson grab was used to sample stations 75-005 to75-034 from a small boat. These stations were sampled by a fisheriesgroup from the Arctic Biological Station .In 1975 a dredge of Our design was used t o sample stations 75-570.75-572. and 75-574 from Pandora II.Four stations were occupied by Pisces IV: 74-243 in 1974. and75-337. 75-339. and 75-341 in 1975. These stations were in thevicinity of Herschel Island.Kinds of grabs usedFour kinds of grabs were used in sampling the 102 stations:The Petterson grab (Foerst. Chicago) samples an area of 6.065 m2and has a volume of about 5 liters.The Wildco Ponar grab samples an area of 0.05 m2 and has a volumeof about 7.1 liters.The Wildco Petersen grab samples an area of 0.09 m2 and has a volumeof about 9.7 liters.The Ekman grab samples an area of 0.023 m2 and has a volume of about3.6 liters.Collecting and processing grab samplesThe area sampled by grab at each station varied from 0.23 to0.39 m2. with the exception of stations A to G. which were 0+07 m2.and station 200 which was 0.12 m2. The number of grabs taken ateach station varied with type of grab used. This data can be foundin Table 2. In some instances a substrate sample was taken from onehalf of one grab sample and the remaining portion was discarded.leaving only one half of the grab t o be combined with the other grabsamples from the station.Only adequate grab samples were retained. An adequate sampleis one in which the grab samples the bottom evenly. samples atleast 2 liters of substrate. and is closed when brought to the surface.Depth of penetratlon into the substrate may vary with type of substrate.but at most stations depth of penetration was from 6 to 10 cm.After the collection of a set of grabs from a station. substrateand organisms were washed on a stainless steel screen with a mesh sizeof 0.5 mm. Retained invertebrates and debris were preserved in formalin(1 part formaldehyde with 9 parts water) for transporting to the ArcticBiological Station where they were processed.Processing consists of sorting. identifying. counting and weighingspecimens in each sample.Each sample was sorted by hand using a Wild M5 dissectingmicroscope. Specimens were identified to species in most cases andcounts of specimens for each species were recorded. Speciesidentification was not attempted for a few taxa. such as nematodes.nemerteans. hydroids . and bryozoans. and although several species maybe involved. they were listed by taxon on a collective basis. In asimilar manner sponges. bryozoans. hydroids. and other colonial formswere regarded as one individual . Protozoans were arbitrarily excludedfrom the study. Stations 75-012 to 75-015 (Tables 90 to 93) includefreshwater species which were separated but not identified. Thesespecies were not included in the Beaufort Sea species list (Table 4).After sorting and identification. specimens were dried (dryingoven at 100?C overnight) and weighed on a Sartorius gravimetric balanceto four decimal places. The dry weight excludes tubes and shells. butno effort was made to eliminate gut contents. The calcareous partsof echinoderms and the skeletal parts of sponges are included in thedry weight because of difficulty in separating organic and inorganicparts.Data are presented on a m2 basis (Tables 8-108). For each samplenumber and weight of individuals of each species were multiplied by afactor t o convert sample values to m2 values. As an example. valuesderived from a sample area of 0.25 m2 were multiplied by 4 to obtain them2 values. The factor was rounded off t o the nearest 0.5; thus. afactor of 2.5 (instead of 2.6) was used to multiply values from a samplewith an area of 0-39 m2 in converting t o m2 values. Most species collectedby grab were considered to be representative. and their sample values wereconverted to m2 equivalents in a consistent manner. In a few cases. asindicated. the sample values were used without converting. becauserepresentation of occasionally collected. usually large. epifaunal speciescould not be assessed.Collecting and processing dredgesIn 1975 a dredge of our own design was used to sample the epifaunaat stations 75-570. 75-572. and 75-574. The dredge consisted of ametal frame with a net attached. The net was 1 m wide. 2 m long.and had a mesh size of 5 mm. Too few dredges were taken for thedata to be of general application. Estimates of biomass for theepifaunal component were obtained for only two of the three stations.The dredge haul at station 75-574 was aborted. Collected species fromal 1 three hauls were included in the Beaufort Sea species list (Table 4).Dredge data are presented in Tables 109-111. The estimates includethe weight contribution of some infaunal elements that were collectedby dredge. No attempt was made to determine total biomass of astation . by combining epifaunal and infaunal values. Associated datarelating to the dredge hauls are presented in Table 3. Total valuesare presented in Table 6.Observations from Pisces IVThese comments are related by the senior author.A familiarization dive was made in Pisces IV at station 74-243.located 12 miles northeast of Herschel Island. in 135 m of water on5 Sep 1974. Incident light became extinguished at a depth of 35 m.During the descent a variety of objects were visible in the murkywater; amphipods. copepods. mysids. medusae. ctenophores. and stringsof organic matter. The bottom was level. undisturbed by ice keels.and the sediment was fine without rocks. Visibility was 3-4 m.Small mounds and depressions were evident. but epifauna was sparseand patchy. with concentrations no less than 10 or 15 m apart.. Speciesseen during the dive were: burrowing anemones (Cemanthus ?) . i sopods(Mesidotea) pycnogonids (Nymphon). brittle stars ( Ophiocten aericeumand Gorgonocephalus ) . asteroids (Urasterias lincki. Icasterias panopla.Ctenodiscus crispatus. Solaster papposus) . and a fish (sculpin ?). Nobenthic algae were seen. In one area of about 12 m2 there were oneUraeteriae lincki. one Icasterias panopla. two burrowing anemones . oneSolaster papposus. several pycnogonids. and some scattered Ophioctensericeum. Based on dried specimens at the Arctic Biological Station.the estimated biomass of epifauna within the 12 m2 was about 70 gwhich averages out to 5.7 g m-2.In 1975 three dives were made in Thetis Bay. immediately southof Herschel Island on the 2nd. 3rd. and 4th of September. Originally.it was planned to sample several areas across the shelf of the southernBeaufort Sea in order to determine the contribution of epifauna tototal biomass ; however. ice conditions restricted diving to thethree sitess in Thetis Bay.A metal frame. which was one square meter in size. was held bythe arm of the submersible in front of the viewing port and countsof epifauna. large animals that were seen with the unaided eye. weremade at intermittant stops of the submersible. The metal frame hada diagonal brace. so counts could be made in the whole square or inhalf of the square.The dive at station 75-337 was made in depths of water of 45 t o56 m. Counts of the most abundant species. Ophiocten sericeum. weremade within the whole frame of 1 m . The range of counts was 7-19as observed within 16 frame counts averaging 14.5 Ophioctensericeum m-2. The calculated biomass (dry weight) was 1.64 m-2. OneMesidotea and one Ophiopleura borealis were observed within one of the16 frame counts. The dry weight of each of these was about 1 g. whichaverages about 0.13 g m-2. thus bringing the epifaunal biomass to1.77 g m-2 at this station.The dive at station 75-339 occurred in 20 t o 30 m depth of water.Counts of Mesidotea sp.. the only genus observed within the 34 one-halfm2 frames. were 0-3 m translating into 28 individuals in 17 m2.resulting in an average of 9.65 individuals m-2. Biomass was estimatedt o be 1.86 g m-2. Other species observed. b u t not within the frame.were Urasieriae lincki . Ctenodiscus crispatus. and either Buccinun orNeptunea with its egg mass.The dive at station 75-341 was made in 18 to 22 m of water alongthe ridge separating the basin of Thetis Bay from Herschel Trench.Some incident light reaches the bottom at these depths. Scouring wassevere giving rise to a mosaic of scoured trenches and undisturbed areas.Random frame counts were not attempted at this station. but the distributionof epifauna appeared to be patchy in the undisturbed areas. OneUrasteriae lincki and one Mesidotea sp. were observed in the scours. Inthe undisturbed areas the above species.along with Cerianthus sp..Gersemia rubifomis. Pecten sp. . a sponge. and some hydroids were seen.

The MNCR was initiated to provide a comprehensive baseline of information on marine habitats and their associated species around the coast of Britain which would aid coastal zone and sea-use management and to contribute to the identification of areas of marine natural heritage importance. The focus of MNCR work was on benthic habitats (often referred to as biotopes) in intertidal and inshore (typically within 3nm) subtidal areas.The majority of data were collected using methods described in the MNCR Rationale and Methods report (Hiscock 1996). Broadly. this encompassed surveying a range of sites within a geographical area to sample and describe the variety of habitats present (sampling habitats in different substrata. depths. wave exposures. current regimes. salinity regimes and so on).

In total. observers spent 10.613 days-at-sea during which 5.895 sets and 6.137 hauls were observed (Figure 2 and Table 1). POP procedure is to count any haul that is interrupted intentionally to allow the gear to soak longer. or that is interrupted for weather or mechanical problems for longer than 6 hours. as a ?split haul? (i.e. a single set that has two or more hauls associated with it). Further. during the 2001 NED experimental fishery each set was divided into 2 hauls. This accounts for the discrepancy between numbers of sets and numbers of hauls.Of the trips monitored. a total of 206 vessels were observed at least once during this time period. Data from 4 trips were excluded from analysis in this report because the gear was set as bottom longline and directed at shark species.Although a wide variety of fish were caught by the observed longline vessels. only about six species were routinely valued by the fishery as a marketable product. These primary species (swordfish. yellowfin tuna. bigeye tuna. bluefin tuna. mahi-mahi. and shortfin mako) comprise about 56% by number (N=120.295) of the total observed catch. Of the total observed fish (Figure 5). swordfish made up 30% by number of the catch; while yellowfin. bigeye. and bluefin tunas. combined. made up 18% by number of the observed catch. Sharks and rays. a bycatch of the tuna and swordfish fishery. made up the other major portion of the pelagic longline catch. about 29% by number.Observer coverage took place in all of the 11 geographical areas shown in Figure 1. As an overview of the observed longline gear deployed. the shortest average length of mainline set on an observed trip was 4.4 nautical miles (NM) while the longest average set during a trip was 46.6 NM. Additionally. during the 6.137 hauls observed. a total of 4.138.830 hooks were recorded (Table 1).The average minimum and maximum depths of the baited hooks are similar for the MAB. NEC. and NED (Table 5). with a range from 9 to 19 fathoms (17-35 m) for the three geographical areas. This represents the shallowest of the three general fishing depth groupings observed. Generally speaking. observed vessels fishing in the waters of the MAB and NEC target more on tuna species while the NED is typically directed more at swordfish (Fig. 6). The second grouping includes the GOM. FEC. SAB. and TUS. with a range of 18 to 36 fathoms (33-66 m). Vessels observed fishing in the waters off the southeast U.S. (FEC and SAB) and down below 5 degrees of North latitude (TUS) target mostly swordfish. with yellowfin generally found as a by-catch. whereas observed vessels in the GOM primarily target yellowfin tuna with a by-catch of swordfish. The deepest fishing depth grouping includes the CAR. SAR. NCA. and TUN with a range of 31 to 42 fathoms (57-77 m). Observed effort in these areas was almost completely directed at swordfish. These data suggest that fishing depths depends more on the area fished rather than target species. For example. observed hook fishing depth was shallowest in the NED and deepest in the CAR but in both areas the target species was swordfish.

The summer RV survey follows a stratified random sampling design (Halliday and Kohler 1971). and includes both hydrographic sampling and sampling of fish and invertebrates using a bottom otter trawl.The bottom trawl survey was originally planned to provide biomass and abundance trends for groundfish residing at depths from about 50 m to 400 m. and was extended to cover depths down to 750 m in 1999.There were changes to the net used and the vessel conducting the survey in 1982 and 1983. From 1970 ? 1981 the RV A.T. Cameron. a side-trawler using the Yankee 36 trawl. was used for the survey. In 1982. the RV Lady Hammond was used. towing a Western IIA trawl. Since 1983. the Alfred Needler has been the primary survey vessel. and the Western IIA trawl has been used in all years. Conversion factors were calculated for net and vessel changes (Fanning 1985).For long-term averages. the most appropriate starting point has been selected for each species. In the case of white hake. biomass plots start in 1970 but the abundance index data only go back to 1982. For silver hake. biomass plots and abundance index data are used starting in 1982. This is in conjunction with the change in the type of trawl. from a Yankee 36 to a Western IIA. as well as more consistent identification of white hake and red hake.In 2010. additional survey tows were completed in deeper water off the shelf edge (750 ? 1.800 m) to investigate species composition and biomass in deeper waters. Catches from these stations are not included in the biomass index estimates. to ensure that comparability with other years is maintained. Distribution plots are included here only for the most abundant species noted at these depths. Tables of the entire catches at these depths are also presented.The survey area has been divided into three zones. based on oceanography and biogeography. Trends are shown for the entire shelf survey area. and also for three separate regions: eastern Scotian Shelf (4VW; strata 440 - 466). western Scotian Shelf (4X East; strata 470 - 481). and Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy (4X West; strata 482 - 495). Differences in patterns of fish abundance and species composition are apparent for these regions during the survey. Strata 496 - 498 (the shelf edge; 350 m ? 750 m) have been sampled in most years since 1996. while strata 501 - 505 (750 m ? 1.800 m) have not previously been sampled as part of the stratified random survey series. These depths are considered separate biogeographic zones and since they have not been sampled in all years. are not included in the long-term biomass index estimates.Plots of the size and distribution of catches are provided for selected species and stratified average catches are compared with past results to provide a general overview of trends in abundance and biomass. For select commercial species where individual fish weights have been collected throughout most of the time series. trends in condition (Fulton?s K: weight/length3) are also included (Ricker 1975).Data are presented for the major commercial species. for species that comprise a large part of the survey catch. and for species where the 2010 catch was either unusually high or low (see also DFO 2011a). The set of species examined to determine if catches in 2010 were unusual was restricted to those where the area occupied exceeded 7.000 square nautical miles (approximately 1/7th of the surveyed area) in 2010. or averaged greater 2 than this in the 1970s. the 1980s or the 1990s. The species examined were restricted in this manner to avoid rare species for which catches display high inter-annual variability.Comparisons of stratified length frequencies for 2009 and 2010 to the long-term mean are also included for major commercial fish species. These data were summarized to assist in reviewing trends in abundance that are directly relevant to fisheries management when they are developing advice on allowable catch; hence. these data are grouped by the applicable stock management areas for each species.

Working at depths of 3 to 16 m with teams using other existing rapid assessment methods. a method for algal assessment is needed that will minimize the time in the water yet yield the greatest amount of data possible. A high-resolution digital camera mounted on a 0.18 m? photo quadrat frame (Fig.1) with an Ikelite Substrobe digital slave strobe has been built to quantitatively assess marine algae.In addition to photographs. data from each quadrat are recorded on a waterproof data sheet that includes space for recording the species found in the quadrat. a ?map? area for identifying cryptic species in depressions that may prove difficult in computer analysis. and codes for the most common genera and species of macroalgae. corals. invertebrates. and substrate types to standardize and shorten note taking.Two trained observers move along the transect together with one observer placing the framer and operating the camera and the other taking notes. (Fig.2). Photographs are taken at predetermined random points.After a photograph is taken by the first diver. the second diver identifies algae within the photoquadrat. records the relative abundance of the 5 most abundant algae on a scale of 1 ? 5 (with 1 being most abundant). draws a quadrat map locating species that may be hard to identify in a photograph. and collects representative samples of the algal species in the quadrats for later identification in the laboratory.Once data are recorded. the photoquadrat is moved to the next random point and the procedure repeated. To prevent redundancy. only samples of new algal species found in subsequent quadrats are collected. In the laboratory the photographs taken with the photoquadrat methods are downloaded to a computer. renamed with a unique location code. then cropped and color corrected in Adobe Photoshop using autocorrect.Each photo is analyzed for percent cover using the software PhotoGrid (C. Bird. Dept. of Botany. University of Hawaii). a software program capable of random and stratified random point analysis on digital photography. Once all photos are analyzed. data are imported into Microsoft Excel for further statistical application.Ultimately. field-collected specimens will be critically analyzed in the laboratory to ensure positive species identification. will be cataloged. and will subsequently be placed in research institutions where they can be accessed by researchers interested in a suite of topics ranging from taxonomy to bioprospecting.After identification. provisions are made to ensure appropriate preservation and curation of each specimen. providing a historical record that will be available to future researchers.

NOAA-certified CRED divers conduct towed diver surveys as a method of assessing relatively large areas of reef habitat. This method involves towing two divers behind a small surface craft that is moving at a velocity of 1-2 mph. Although the driver of the surface craft attempts to follow a depth contour. the divers also actively maneuver the ?towboards? they are holding onto so as to maintain a relatively constant elevation above the surface of the reef.    One of the two towboards is equipped with a digital videocamera that is pointing in the forward-looking direction so as to document both the ?rugosity ?. or 3-dimensional topography. of the reef. as well as the fish associated with the reef. The other towboard is equipped with a digital videocamera that is pointing in the downward-looking direction. so as to record the benthos over which the diver and camera are moving.    Divers maneuvering the towboards on which the cameras are mounted record selected data pertaining to fish and to habitat. using datasheets mounted on the towboards. These in-situ observations are used to assist with preliminary summaries of the fish communities and the reef habitat. and as a general reference during more detailed. computer-assisted analyses.    Both towboards are equipped with a SEABIRD sensor that records depth and water temperature every 5 seconds. so that biotic observations can be linked to salient physical parameters.    A GPS unit on the surface tow vessel records the trackline over which the divers. and recording cameras. are being towed. so that the results that are later generated by analysis of the digital videos can be linked to geographic position.    A complete towboard survey is 50 minutes in length. and covers close to 2 miles of reef.Analysis of Towboard Benthic VideotapesUsing computer-assisted technology. the images captured by the downward-pointed camera of the benthic habitat are quantified as percent cover of the principle components that can be recognized from the videotapes. These components include: live coral. unencrusted (recently dead) coral. macroalgae. turf algae. coralline algae. other invertebrates. sand. rock. pavement. and rubble.The suite of corals that can be identified from the videotapes depends upon the assemblage of corals present in the area being surveyed (e.g.. the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are less speciose than the U.S. Line & Phoenix Islands). and in general is limited to the genus level of identification. Similarly. algae can typically be identified from the videotapes only according to their functional class (macro. turf. coralline).Thus. while towed diver surveys are capable of assessing large areas of reef. it requires more stationary divers working at smaller spatial scales during REA surveys to achieve a higher degree of taxonomic resolution.

These video sequences enable later. computer-assisted quantitative analyses of percent coverage of corals. algae. and substrate types. Additionally. at the beginning of each of the transect lines. a 360? pan of the surrounding reef area is slowly videotaped to document the topography and general nature of the surrounding area.The coral biologist then swims back along as many of the transect lines as bottom time permits and lists coral species occurring within 0.5 m? of each side of the transect lines and the size class to which the maximum diameter of the colony belongs ( 5 cm; 5?10 cm; 10-20 cm; 20-40cm; 40-80 cm; 80-160 cm; or 160 cm). In geographic regions such as the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands where coral richness and abundance are reduced relative to lower latitude regions with higher species richness. the protocol is amended to include all corals occurring within 1m of each side of the transect lines.A random swim is then conducted in the vicinity of the transect lines within an area of about 5.000m2 in which all coral species are listed and assigned a DACOR abundance code based on visual estimation (dominant. abundant. common. occasional. and rare).

Together. 20 separate strata exist.With the addition of the fourth strata. the total survey area increased from ~3.626 nauticalmiles (NM2) to ~4.665 NM2. To keep sampling density of the original strata roughlyequivalent with previous surveys. an additional 15 stations were added to the originalgoal of 100 stations per survey. A target of 115 stations is selected for sampling in eachsurvey resulting in a sampling density of 1 station for every 40 NM2. Number of towsper stratum is apportioned according to its total area (Tables 1 and 2).SELECTION OF RANDOM STATIONSRandom stations are selected from a NOAA nautical chart in Arc ViewTM GIS overlainwith 1-NM2 grids. Each grid within each region is assigned a unique identificationnumber that serves as a call number. Grids are selected using an ExcelTM random numbergenerator. Tows approximately 1 NM long are proposed in each grid and plotted in PSeaWindplotTM (using charts of the NAD 1983 datum). From prior experience and localknowledge. some grids are classified as untowable during the plotting process. Due tothe large amount of fixed gear and the appeal to fishermen to cooperate with the surveyby clearing the tows. identifying good tow locations is a priority. If no towable bottomcan be found within a 2-mile radius. a new random number is chosen within the samestratum. Beginning and end points of each tow are identified in P-Sea Windplot.

In areas where previous workhad been done. the stations were selected due to their historical importance3. In areas withno history. one station was selected as being roughly representative of the average catchfor its respective stratum and the other was randomly selected. After the addition of thefourth stratum in the spring of 2003. fixed stations were designated for that stratum usingthe same criteria.FISHING GEARTrawl design considerations for the survey include effectiveness of the gear forsampling the complex bottom in the nearshore areas of the Gulf of Maine andcomparability with previous and ongoing surveys by NMFS and MassachusettsDivision of Marine Fisheries. The net is a modified version of the shrimp netdesign used in Maine waters (Appendix A). designed to fish for a variety of nearbottomdwelling species without targeting any specific component. RobertTetrault. the vessels? owner. and net designer Jeff Flagg designed the net to fishfeet in length with nominal horsepower. Three identical nets were constructed forthis survey in the event of tearing or loss. Net tapers were cut to permit the shapeof the net to get maximum height while allowing the net to remain tight on thebottom. The net is shackled from the footrope to the frame with two 3/8th inchshackles to a banded wire that runs parallel with the footrope. Heavy rubber wingbobbins retard bottom wing lift at the net end of the bottom leg. Top legs are7/16th wire. 60 feet in length with soft eyes at each end. and bottom legs are 5/8thinch wire. 58 feet in length with two feet of 5/8th inch chain at the end where theleg attaches to the bottom wing for a total of 60 feet. Bottom legs are coveredwith 2 -3/8? cookies to prevent them from digging into the mud. The net isconstructed of 2-inch #24 polyethylene mesh. with a 1-inch (stretched measure)mesh liner in the cod end. Otter boards are #7.5 Bisons. Attached to the 70-foot.5/8th inch Rander?s Combination Wire Rope footrope is a roller frame strung onto?? IPS of 6x19 construction with a fiber core. The ten-foot wide bosom section ismade up of eight-inch rubber discs on six-inch centers along with eight evenlyspaced toggles. Spacing is maintained by smaller four-inch cookies strungbetween the discs. The two 29-foot wing sections are made up of six-inch rubberdiscs spaced 4 ? inches apart. with the same four inch cookies used to maintainspacing.

(I) The beam trawl. ofwhich descriptions and figures may be found in several previous reports of the UnitedStates Fish Commission (Verrill. 1883; Tanner. 1884. 1897). The trawls employed inthe present work were quite diminutive in comparison with those used in commercialtrawling. having a beam length (width of aperture) of from 6 to 9 feet. and a depth ofnet not much exceeding 10 feet. This appliance can be employed to best advantage ona level bottom of hard sand or fine gravel. upon which the lead line fits closely. It iswell adapted to scraping 'up the larger mollusks. fishes. crustacea. echinoderms. algre.etc.. which lie upon the surface. but not to penetrating the sand or gravel; and it consequentlyfails to disturb those forms which burrow in even a slight degree. For thisreason. and because of the large size of its meshes. the beam trawl was commonly notemployed alone; but a dredge of the next type was ordinarily appended to the lowerend of the bag. '(2) The ordinary naturalists' dredge. of the type originally devised by O. F. Muller(see Verrill. 1883; Tanner. 1884. 1897; Agassiz. 1888). This. as is well known. consistsof a heavy. rectangular. iron frame. to which is fitted the mouth of a bag of stoutnetting. In the commoner pattern the two longer sides of the frame consist of sharp.outwardly flaring edges. adapted to cutting into the sand. gravel. or mud; and thedredge is practically certain to drag in such a way that one or the other of these edges islowermost.A modification of this type of dredge which was freely used during the present workwas the rake dredge. which differs from the ordinary pattern in possessing heavy teethalong the cutting edge. The frame. in both types. is fitted with two heavy movableiron arms. to which the dredge line is attached. Commonly acomparatively light ropewas fastened to one of these hahdles. so that in case an obstruction was encounteredthis line might part and allow the dredge frame to free itself without escaping altogether.The dredge net was protected from tearing by a sheathing of heavy canvas. which wasattached to the frame outside of the net and formed a bag. open at the lower end. Thenetting commonly employed in these dredges had a t-inch or a r-inch mesh a in theupper portion. while the lower end was quite closely woven. Such meshes were likelyto retain not only the stones. shells. and the great majority of living organisms. buteven considerable quantities of the bottom material. Fine loose sand. however. and inless degree mud. were likely to be washed out almost completely during the reeling inof the dredge line. Where such bottoms were encountered the canvas sheathing of thedredge was frequently tied up at the lower end. or sometimes a simple canvas bag alone(mud bag) was attached to the frame. During the last season of the regular dredgingwork (1905) the mud bag was nearly always employed in connection with the beamtrawl. It is obvious that a much fairer bottom sample could be collected in this way.'The dimensions of the frame in the type most commonly used during the Fish Hawkdredging were 12 by 22 inches. A smaller size (8 by 16 inches) was. however. sometimesused in the Phalarope and Blue Wing work.(3) The third type of dredge employed was the oyster dredge. This was intermediatein size between the beam trawl and the scrape dredge and was very heavilyconstructed. being well adapted to use upon rocky bottoms. The scraping edge at themouth of this implement was armed with powerful spikes or teeth. designed to dig deeplyinto the sand or gravel. The bag of the dredge was made up of iron rings. linkedtogether after the fashion of chain armor. In order to retain the smaller organisms.this chainwork bottom was commonly lined with fine netting. The oyster dredge wasemployed on bottoms too stony for the other appliances. or where it was desired topenetrate more deeply beneath the surface.The Fish Hawk is a steam vessel having a length of 146 feet at the water line. orof 156 feet over all. a beam of 27 feet. and a draft of about 7 feet. She carries adequatemachinery for the reeling in of heavy dredges. and despite her limited speed and unseaworthyconstruction is an extremely serviceable vessel for scientific operations in quietwaters. A full description of the Fish Hawk has already been given by Tanner (1884).and therefore need not be repeated here.The material taken by the Fish Hawk dredges was commonly emptied into a seriesof trays. constituting the table sieve of Verrill and Chester (Verrill. 1883). having gradedmeshes. the coarser ones naturally being uppermost. After a superficial examinationand preliminary search for specimens a stream of salt water was played upon the material.and the sand. mud. and small unattached organisms were thus washed into theunderlying. smaller-meshed trays. The contents of each tray were examined in turn.according to a system to be described later.The Tanner sounding apparatus a was employed at each of the Fish Hawk stations.together with the Sigsbee water specimen cup. and the Negretti-Zambra thermometer.Thus the temperature and density were recorded. as well as the depth of the water.It was later realized. however. that the figures for temperature and density obtainedduring the regular dredging operations were not sufficiently exact for the purposes ofthe work. and. likewise. that no fair comparison would be possible of the differentwaters in the region unless we possessed a set of determinations which had been madenearly or quite simultaneously throughout its entire extent. For this reason a new setof temperature and density observations. taken with standardized instruments andwithin the briefest period possible. was made after the completion of the dredgingwork. Such determinations were repeated several times at intervals of a few months.so that the seasonal conditions are now pretty well known. These will be discussed ina later section.The position of the vessel was determined in the earlier part of the work by meansof an azimuth compass located on the roof of the deck house. just abaft the pilot house.Bearings were taken upon two. sometimes three. landmarks. usually lighthouses. Thiswas commonly done just before the lowering of the dredge. The station. as recordedon the chart. was thus the point where the dredge haul commenced. while thedirection and amount of the drift was estimated rather roughly. Later. tripods wereerected upon a number of Coast Survey triangulation points and sextants were employedin locating the ship's position. Angles were taken simultaneously by two observers.one of whom found the angular distance between X and Y. the other that betweenY and Z. The position of the vessel was determined both at the beginning and at theend of the dredge haul. and frequently at one or two intermediate points. Thus uponthe maps the later stations in Vineyard Sound appear not as single circles but as straightor curved lines. at intervals in which are to .be found the points (a. b. c. etc.) at which? sextant readings were taken.The Phalarope is a steam vessel. originally designed as a yacht. having a length of82 feet at the water line. or of 92 feet over all. and a beam of 16 feet. She draws 7Ufeet of water. and her average speed is probably about II knots. The Phalarope carriesno dredging machinery and is not permanently equipped for this work. In landing thedredge a small derrick was employed. this being operated by hand power. The contentswere emptied upon a special movable platform built over the forward cabin. A set ofsieves was employed similar in principle but smaller than those used on the Fish HouikWith this vessel the use of the beam trawl was impracticable. and even the oyster dredgewas too heavy to be employed very frequently. though it was used to advantage undercertain conditions. The second type of dredge mentioned above was therefore the.principal one employed.Since the Phalarope dredging was. for the most part. done within a quarter of amile from land. it was found to be possible to locate the stations with a fair degree ofaccuracy by reference to features of the shore. Bearings upon lighthouses were notcommonly practicable. nor indeed were they believed to be especially desirable. Thesoundings indicated. with sufficient precision. the distance from land. and the directionof various landmarks was noted. An ideal degree of accuracy in locating these stationsmight have been attained through the sacrifice of much time and effort. but it is doubtfulwhether the scientific value of this report would thereby have been greatly enhanced.In the case of both vessels the same general procedure was adopted in respect tothe listing and the preservation of material. One or more of the authors of this reportaccompanied each dredging trip. and one or several assistants were detailed from thelaboratory staff. On many occasions specialists interested in particular groups oforganisms accompanied us on these expeditions and participated in the identifications.The more obvious and easily recognizable species were listed on the spot. mention beingmade of their relative abundance and other facts of interest. These observations weredictated to an assistant. At the same time samples of the sand. stones. mud. seaweed. etc..and any specimens concerning which the least doubt was entertained were preserved. witha record of the station from which they came. This material was later sorted over in thelaboratory and further species were identified and listed. Those concerning which therewas still any doubt were bottled and subsequently referred to the proper specialists.

NC to Cape Canaveral. FL).Purpose: For thirty years. the Marine Resources Research Institute (MRRI) at the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR). through the Marine Resources Monitoring. Assessment and Prediction (MARMAP) program. has conducted fisheries-independent research on groundfish. reef fish. ichthyoplankton. and coastal pelagic fishes within the region between Cape Lookout. North Carolina. and Ft Pierce. Florida. The overall mission of the program has been to determine distribution. relative abundance. and critical habitat of economically and ecologically important fishes of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB). and to relate these features to environmental factors and exploitation activities. Research toward fulfilling these goals has included trawl surveys (from 6-350 m depth); ichthyoplankton surveys; location and mapping of reef habitat; sampling of reefs throughout the SAB; life history and population studies of priority species; tagging studies of commercially important species and special studies directed at specific management problems in the region. Survey work has also provided a monitoring program that has allowed the standardized sampling of fish populations over time and development of an historical base for future comparisons of long-term trends. Annual MARMAP cruises to assess relative abundance of reef fishes in the sponge-coral and shelf edge (live bottom) habitats of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) have been conducted since 1978. MARMAP currently samples natural live bottom habitat from Cape Lookout. NC to the Ft. Pierce area. FL. The current main MARMAP objectives are to: (1) Sample reef fishes in the snapper-grouper complex at using a variety of gears in live bottom. rocky outcrop. high relief. and mud bottom habitats. (2) Collect detailed data for time series description of species for annual composition and relative abundance. (3) Obtain population characteristics on fish species of interest through life history information analysis. including age and growth. sex ratio. size and age of sexual maturation and transition. spawning season. fecundity. and diet. Priorities are dictated by the SEDAR schedule and other management considerations. (4) Collect hydrographic data (e.g. depth. temperature. salinity. etc.) for comparison to fish abundance and composition indices. (5) Collect DNA samples from selected fish species for stock identification. (6) Expand sampling area in North Carolina and south Florida as well as reconnoiter new live bottom areas with underwater video (UWTV) to add to the MARMAP site database.

The study areaThe coastal upwelling zone of Chile  (Fig. 1) extends from 18?Sto about 42?S. i.e. nearly 2700 km of coast along the latitudinalgradient. Because of different seasonal regimes of the upwellingprocess. two major upwelling regions can be distinguished.(1)The northern upwelling region(18??30?  S). and (2) the Central/southern upwelling region (30??42?S). Both regions are known torepresent key coastal upwelling systems supporting high primaryproduction rates (Daneri et al..2000). strong fishery activitymostly based on small pelagic fishes(Alheit and Bernal.1993;Arcos et al..2001) and are subjected to strong interannualvariability forced by the ENSO (El Nino southern oscillation) cycle(Escribano et al..2004).2.2. Data sourcesLocations of all sampling sites are illustrated in Fig. 1. For thisstudy. we used samples from northern Chile obtained during theyears 2005. 2006 and 2007. The first set of samples comes fromthe ZOMEI Cruise carried out between September and October2005 at two locations off 20?S and 22?S. We used the samplesfrom a single station at each site sampled day and night in 5 depthstrata down to 700m. All these samples were obtained withvertical tows of a Hydrobios Midi-type multinet (0.25m2 openingmouth) equipped with five 200 mm mesh-size nets. A second setof samples came from the CENSOR (Climate Variability and the ElNino Southern Oscillation) project through which two fixednear shore stations located off Chipana at 21?S (90 m depth) andMejillones 23?S (85 m depth) were sampled during severalconsecutive days (5?8 days) in the summers and winters 2005.2006 and 2007. In both sites. the samples were obtained in twodepth strata with vertical tows of a 0.196m2 opening mouth WPnet having a 200 mm mesh-size net.In the Central/southern region samples came from twosources. Firstly the COPAS Time Series Study off Concepcion(Escribano and Schneider. 2007). In this study. zooplanktonsamples were obtained monthly at the fixed Station 18 using a200 mm mesh-size 1m2 Tucker Trawl net to wedobliquely at twodepth strata(0?50 m and 50?80m). Details on samplin gearprovided in Escribano et al.(2007). For this work.we used onlythe samples obtained during  2002 and 2003. which have beenanalyzed in detail for copepod composition. Monthly changes ofdominant copepod species (10% of total species) were previouslyassessed for the period 2002?2005 (Escribano et al..2007). and forthe period 2002?2008 the same dominant species were used toestimate interannual changes in copepod biomass (Escribanoet al.. submitted for publication). A second set of samples for thissouthern region came from the BIOZOO cruise carried outin winter 2008 at 5 stations over a cross-shelf transect from 5 to100 km offshore. At each station the same Hydrobios Multinet asabove was deployed to sample 4 strata down to 600 m at theoffshore station. In this case oblique tows were performed tosample a greater volume of water (410 m3) because of lowercopepod density in winter conditions.A total number of 159 samples were analyzed for this study.107 samples were from the Northern region and 52 from theCentral/Southern zone. From these samples. all copepods wereidentified to the species level(adults and copepodids. but notnauplii) and counted. although some very dense samples weresplit with a Folsom splitter to count a maximum number of 200individuals of a single dominant species.

With more than 1900 marine mammal encounters in The Bahamas. we are providing the only comprehensive documentation of the marine mammal fauna in this part of the world. Our research is based on the use of systematic boat-based surveys for describing the distribution and habitat use of different marine mammal species. We employ photo-identification techniques for the recognition of individual whales and dolphins. and we have developed new statistical approaches for using these data to determine abundance estimates and occupancy patterns. This photographic sampling is complemented by the collection of skin and faecal samples for molecular genetic analysis. which are being used to assess levels of genetic diversity and investigate the structuring of marine mammal populations. The dataset presented here includes both marine mammal and turtle sightings. The dataset consists of 89 stranding records between 1944 and 2005. including 15 species with Cuvier?s beaked whale being the most common. Marine mammal sightings data includes 444 sightings between 1988 and 2005. including sightings reported from the public. The dataset includes 1.934 BMMS vessel encounters with marine mammals between 1991 and 2005. comprising 20 different species. with the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin representing 60% of all encounters. Finally. the dataset also includes 101 sightings of turtles comprising 3 different species between 1991 and 2005. Supplemental infomation: A sighting and an encounter is differentiated between where a sighting is when our vessel was unable to close in on the group of animals. and an encounter is when closing was successful and photographs / video recording of the animals were obtained.

Watersamples are collected from sufficient depths (usually 6 depths) within the euphotic zone. including one atthe chlorophyll-a maximum. to properly calibrate the CTD fluorometer; and from the surface and bottom ofthe water column. Water samples are collected using conventionnal sampling equipment (e.g. manuallydeployed Niskin-type bottles on a hydrowire; rosette-mounted sampling bottles) and stored in appropriatecontainers. The volumes of water required for each sample. excluding amounts wasted for rinsing. are asfollows:a) Two 350 ml samples at the surface and at the bottom for oxygen;b) Iwo 30 ml samples at each depth for nutrients;c) Two 100 ml samples at each depth for chlorophyll-a;d) One 100 ml sample from each depth at the fixed stations to be mixed together to produce one largevolume from which a 500 ml subsample is taken for phytoplankton cell counts.e) One 200 ml sample for salinity at the surface and at the bottomSamples should always be drawn in the same order from the bottle: dissolved oxygen first. nutrients next.and then other samples.

The survey is conducted after the local fisheries are closed from early to mid-July and ends in early to mid-September. For the survey. we used a Nephrops bottom trawl towed over the bottom during 5 minutes at a speed of approximately 2 knots. A scanmar (1989-1998) or netmind (1999-present) hydro-acoustic instrumentation system is used to monitor the status of the trawl. such as depth. trawl opening width and height. On board computer systems record the position. time and status of the trawl (Moriyasu et al. 1998). Throughout the years. the snow crab survey has covered an ever widening range of the Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence area. In 1989 for instance. there were 155 stations mostly within Area 12.

The study area surveyed varies from year to year. Details of this specific survey are described below. Surveys are conducted with the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources' (GINR) research vessel Paamiut using either an Alfredo or Cosmos shrimp trawl depending on the focus species of the particular survey. The target set for the Alfredo trawl is 3.0 knots towed for 30 minutes and for the Cosmos trawl 2.6 knots for 15 minutes. Trawl geometry is monitored for door spread. net height and bottom contact with wing spread introduced in 2009. Environmental data. temperature. salinity and depth. is collected with Seamon. Star-Oddi and Seabird equipment. Surveys are stratified random in design based on stratum area proportions with a two set minimum. Sampling sites are allocated using the buffered random sampling (BRS) protocol of Kingsley et al. 2004. Shrimp surveys sample waters from 100-800m stratified in contours of 100-200. 200-300. 300-400. 400-600 and 600-800m. Greenland halibut surveys sample waters from 400-1500m. The 2007 multi-species stock assessment survey of SFA3 and RISA was conducted from 12 October to 7 November. Sixty-none of the seventy sets allocated to SFA3 were taken sucessfully with the Cosmos trawl. Seabird 19plus CTD mounted to the headrope was introduced to the survey in 2007. Experimental work was conducted in RISA in two strata south west of Resolution Island looking at the effects of tide/current and survey design on the overall results of the survey. Samples were collected to examine fecundity and stomach contents of both Pandalid species. This dataset is the OBIS version of the stock assessment survey.

Sites are randomly selected within these strata to ensure coverage of the entire study region and not just a particular reef or seagrass area. At each site. fish. macro-invertebrates. and benthic composition information is then quantified following standardized protocols. By relating the data collected in the field back to the habitat maps and bathymetric models. BT is able to model and map species level and community level information. These protocols are standardized throughout the US Caribbean to enable quantification and comparison of reef fish abundance and distribution trends between locations.Site selection begins by stratifying NOAA's nearshore benthic habitat maps into predetermined habitat strata. Utilizing ArcGIS. sites are then randomly selected within strata throughout the region. Using a handheld GPS unit. the boat captain navigates to previously selected sites. A weighted buoy is dropped to mark any site where live boating is necessary. Once on site. divers are deployed and maintain contact with each other throughout the entirecensus. One diver is responsible for collecting data on the fish communities utilizing the belt transect visual census technique. The belt transect diver obtains a random compass heading prior to entering the water and records the compass bearing (0-360o) on the data sheet. On site. no attempt to avoid structural features within a habitat such as a pile of conch shells. a sand patch or a tire in a seagrass or sand area should be made as these features affect fish communities and are real features of the habitats. Visibility at each site must be sufficient to allow for identification of fish at a minimum of 2m away. Once reasonable visibility is ascertained. the diver attaches a tape measure to the substrate and allows it to roll out as progress is made along the chosen compass heading for a distance of 25m. The transect should take 15 minutes regardless of habitat type or number of animals present. This allows more mobile animals the opportunity to swim through the transect. and standardizes the samples collected to allow for comparisons. As the tape roles out at a relatively constant speed. the diver records all fish species to the lowest taxonomic level possible that come within 2m of either side of the transect. Each survey is 100m2 in area (25m length X 4m width). To decrease the total time spent writing. four letter codes are used that consist of the first two letters of the genus name followed by the first two letters of the species name. In the rare case that two species have the same four-letter code. letters are added to the species name until a difference occurs. If the fish can only be identified to the family or genus level then this is all that is recorded. If the fish cannot be identified to the family level then no entry is necessary. The number of individuals per species is tallied in 5cm size class increments up to 35cm using visual estimation of fork length. If an individual is greater than 35cm. then an estimate of the actual fork length is recorded. Prior to 2002. fork lengths of fish greater than 35 cm were not always recorded. Although the habitat should not be altered in any manner by lifting or moving structure. the observer should record fish seen in holes. under ledges and in the water column. To identify. enumerate. or locate new individuals a diver may move off the centerline of the transect as long as they stay within the 4m transect width and do not look back along area already covered. The diver is allowed to look forward toward the end of the transect for the distance left along the transect (i.e. if the diver is at meter 15. he can look 10 meters distant. but if he is at meter 23. he can only look 2 meters ahead). This diver also takes photos of fishes to document color patterns and phases of the different species.Data Caveats: Overtime. some changes were made to the stratified random site selection process as follows: 1) Habitat strata initially consisted of hard bottom. sand. and seagrass. Sand and seagrass strata were subsequently combined into one soft bottom strata at all three locations (Puerto Rico. St. Croix. and St. John). This action was taken after the February 2002 mission to Puerto Rico. 2) A small subset of sites were resampled during each mission through June 2002 in Puerto Rico and October 2002 in St. Croix. These station names contain the letter 'P' indicating they are permanent stations. 3) The sample area in St. Croix has increased over time. Initially. samples were collected within historic Buck Island National Monument boundaries as well as outside up to a distance of 0.5 km from those boundaries. In February 2002 the sampling effort was increased to include the entire expanded monument boundaries. Finally in April 2003 the effort was increased again to include areas outside of the Monument for control sites. This area is now almost entirely enclosed within the East End Marine Park of St. Croix. 4) The habitat map utilized to stratify the samples in St. Croix was changed from the original habitat map created with a 1 acre minimum mapping unit to one with a 100m2 minimum mapping unit beginning with the April 2003 mission.Process_Date: 200202 Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",Traps,, ,Oct-12,Count,NA,lat_long_general_bottomDepth_date

This grab enables fast sampling. The variability within replicates corresponds to about 13 %. what gives a difference in depth of 0.7 to 1.2 cm (Lie & Pamatmat. 1965). __Processing samples: Every sample (already stained with a Bengal Rose or eosin solution) is decanted (10 times) on a 1000 ?m sieve in order to separate the present fauna from the sediment. With this technique the residue of coarse sediment and fauna is pored into a measuring cup (5 l) and is brought into suspension with a strong jet of water. During this process the smaller and lighter organisms will go into suspension. whereas the heavier sediment and organisms remain on the bottom. The water containing the organisms is there after pored over a 1000 ?m sieve. All retained fauna is stored in a 4-8 % neutral formalin solution and stained with Bengal-Rose of eosin (if not done earlier). Both solutions colour all organic material. This enables easier sorting of the animals. After decantation the residue is checked for bigger and heavier organisms (e.g. Mollusca. Actinaria). Decantation must not be applied to fine sediment samples (< 1000 ?m) as all sediment is directly rinsed through the 1 mm sieve and what remains on the sieve can directly be fixated.     Identification: All organisms are counted and identified. if possible to species level. For some animal groups however this is not the case:Nematoda. Nemertinea. Sipunculida. Turbellaria. Actinaria. Oligochaeta and Copepoda are never identified to a higher level because they are not representative for the macrobenthos community. The sampling technique is not suited to quantify these groups neither.The identification of some taxa is still under discussion. Whether they should be identified up to species level or grouped into complexes is still not clear due to uncertain taxonomy (e.g. Phyllodoce maculata of P. mucosa; Harmotho? spp.; Bathyporeia spp.; Cirratulidae; Capitellidae).    Sediment analysis: Two standard methods were applied: using sieves with different mesh sizesDuring the period 1976-1986 all sediment analyses were done using at least 7 sieves with different mesh size (see table 1). Approximately 25 g of homogenized substrate was used for grain size analysis of the sand fraction according to Buchanan & Kain (1971). The wet-sieved fraction smaller than 63 ?m was used as a measure for mud content.using a Coulter LS 100From 1994 on all sediment samples were analysed using a Coulter counter. Within the measuring range of 2 ?m to 850 ?m the grain sizes are measured. The fraction larger than 850 ?m is separated and expressed as weighed percentage.

North Carolina. and Ft Pierce. Florida. The overall mission of the program has been to determine distribution. relative abundance. and critical habitat of economically and ecologically important fishes of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB). and to relate these features to environmental factors and exploitation activities. Research toward fulfilling these goals has included trawl surveys (from 6-350 m depth); ichthyoplankton surveys; location and mapping of reef habitat; sampling of reefs throughout the SAB; life history and population studies of priority species; tagging studies of commercially important species and special studies directed at specific management problems in the region. Survey work has also provided a monitoring program that has allowed the standardized sampling of fish populations over time and development of an historical base for future comparisons of long-term trends.Annual MARMAP cruises to assess relative abundance of reef fishes in the sponge-coral and shelf edge (live bottom) habitats of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) have been conducted since 1978. MARMAP currently samples natural live bottom habitat from Cape Lookout. NC to the Ft. Pierce area. FL. The current main MARMAP objectives are to:(1) Sample reef fishes in the snapper-grouper complex at using a variety of gears in live bottom. rocky outcrop. high relief. and mud bottom habitats.(2) Collect detailed data for time series description of species for annual composition and relative abundance.(3) Obtain population characteristics on fish species of interest through life history information analysis. including age and growth. sex ratio. size and age of sexual maturation and transition. spawning season. fecundity. and diet. Priorities are dictated by the SEDAR schedule and other management considerations.(4) Collect hydrographic data (e.g. depth. temperature. salinity. etc.) for comparison to fish abundance and composition indices.(5) Collect DNA samples from selected fish species for stock identification.(6) Expand sampling area in North Carolina and south Florida as well as reconnoiter new live bottom areas with underwater video (UWTV) to add to the MARMAP site database Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = AggregatedWeight",Trawl,,1.

The net has a 16.5-m footrope. 11.9-m headrope and the following stretched mesh dimensions: 11.4 cm in the wings. 10.2 cm then to 8.9 cm in the body. 5.1 cm in the cod end. and 1.3 cm in the cod end liner.For thirty years. the Marine Resources Research Institute (MRRI) at the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR). through the Marine Resources Monitoring. Assessment and Prediction (MARMAP) program. has conducted fisheries-independent research on groundfish. reef fish. ichthyoplankton. and coastal pelagic fishes within the region between Cape Lookout. North Carolina. and Ft Pierce. Florida. The overall mission of the program has been to determine distribution. relative abundance. and critical habitat of economically and ecologically important fishes of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB). and to relate these features to environmental factors and exploitation activities. Research toward fulfilling these goals has included trawl surveys (from 6-350 m depth); ichthyoplankton surveys; location and mapping of reef habitat; sampling of reefs throughout the SAB; life history and population studies of priority species; tagging studies of commercially important species and special studies directed at specific management problems in the region. Survey work has also provided a monitoring program that has allowed the standardized sampling of fish populations over time and development of an historical base for future comparisons of long-term trends.Annual MARMAP cruises to assess relative abundance of reef fishes in the sponge-coral and shelf edge (live bottom) habitats of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) have been conducted since 1978. MARMAP currently samples natural live bottom habitat from Cape Lookout. NC to the Ft. Pierce area. FL. The current main MARMAP objectives are to:(1) Sample reef fishes in the snapper-grouper complex at using a variety of gears in live bottom. rocky outcrop. high relief. and mud bottom habitats.(2) Collect detailed data for time series description of species for annual composition and relative abundance.(3) Obtain population characteristics on fish species of interest through life history information analysis. including age and growth. sex ratio. size and age of sexual maturation and transition. spawning season. fecundity. and diet. Priorities are dictated by the SEDAR schedule and other management considerations.(4) Collect hydrographic data (e.g. depth. temperature. salinity. etc.) for comparison to fish abundance and composition indices.(5) Collect DNA samples from selected fish species for stock identification.(6) Expand sampling area in North Carolina and south Florida as well as reconnoiter new live bottom areas with underwater video (UWTV) to add to the MARMAP site database.

USA,"A network of more than 130 permanent vegetation plots provides long-term information on patterns and rates of forest succession in most of the major forest zones of the Pacific Northwest. The plot network extends from the coast to the Cascades in western Oregon and Washington and east to ponderosa pine forests in the Oregon Cascades. Most of the permanent plots were established during two intervals: from 1910 to 1948. and from 1970 to 1989. The earlier plots were established by U.S. Forest Service researchers to quantify timber growth in young stands of important commercial species and to help answer other applied forestry questions. The more recent period of plot establishment began under the Coniferous Forest Biome program of the International Biological Program during the 1970s. and continued under the Long-term Ecological Research program. A broader set of objectives motivated plot establishment since 1970. especially quantification of composition. structure. and population and ecosystem dynamics of natural forests. Plots have one of three spatial arrangements: (1) contiguous rectangles subjectively placed within an area of homogeneous forest; (2) circular plots subjectively placed within an area of homogeneous forest; and (3) circular plots systematically located on long transects to sample an entire watershed. ridge. or reserve. Rectangular study areas are mostly 1.0 ha or 0.4 ha (1.0 ac) in size (slope-corrected). Circular plots are 0.1 ha (0.247 ac). not corrected for slope. The tree stratum is the focus of work in closed-forest study areas. All trees larger than a minimum diameter (5 cm for most areas) are permanently tagged. Plots are censused every 5 or 6 years. Attributes measured or assessed at each census include tree diameter. tree vigor. and the condition of the crown and stem. The same attributes are recorded for trees (ingrowth) that have exceeded the minimum diameter since the previous census. In many plots tree locations are surveyed to provide a plot-specific x-y location. A mortality assessment is done for trees that have died since the previous census. The assessment characterizes rooting. stem. and crown condition. obvious signs of distress or disturbance. and the apparent predisposing and proximate causes of tree death. ____ Experimental Design - TV010: Description: The sites were selected subjectively to represent modal examples of the major habitat types in the H.J. Andrews area (usually with a mature and old growth example). Some stands (e.g.riparian) were selected for other reasons. The stands are remeasured at 5 to 10 year intervals to provide growth and regeneration information.Field Methods - TV010 : Description: The stands are surveyed into 25 X 25 slope corrected subplots marked with permanent stakes. All trees greater than the minimum size (usually 5 cm dbh) are tagged. diametered. vigor coded. and mapped. The mapping is done using a 5 X 5 m grid formed with string as a guide.

The 40 non-riparian sites are a subset of the 200 CAP- LTER points. We are using point counts to survey birds four times a year (January. April. July and October). During each session each point is visited by three birders who count all birds seen or heard for 15 minutes. Our goal is to study how different land-use forms affect bird abundance. distribution and diversity in the greater Phoenix area in order to predict and preserve high bird species diversity as urban development is proceeding. We have now just completed 3 years of monitoring. and are also beginning to see some of the sites changing due to new urban development. The results described below are based on analyses of the first two years? data. _______Bird Point Count Survey - GeneralA point count consists of one person standing in a specific location. for a fixed length of time. at a specific time of day. and counting all birds seen and heard within a specific distance (Fixed Radius.) or as far as the eye can see (Open Radius.)CAP-LTER uses 15-minute observation time spans.Counts are done within 4 hours of local sunrise.Counts are done using the Open Radius method.ADDITIONAL OBSERVERSThe primary observer may be accompanied to the plot area by an additional observer. However. only the primary observer should stand at plot center. and only the observations of the primary observer should be recorded on the data sheet. To avoid any bias that would invalidate the data collected. the secondary observer should not verbalize. point out birds. or give any non-verbal cues to the primary observer.Please note in the Notes column of the data sheet if an additional observer was present during the count.If the secondary observer sees something especially interesting that the primary observer did not see. it may be noted in the Notes column.COUNT CONDITIONSThe first point count should be started no earlier than local sunrise. The final point count should be finished no later than 4 hours past local sunrise.Do not conduct point counts in steady. or heavy rain. (It is okay to conduct counts in light. intermittent drizzle. but be sure to make note of this in the Weather line of the data sheet.)Do not conduct point counts in steady winds above 20 mph.APPROACHING THE PLOTApproach the plot as quietly as possible to minimize disturbance to the birds present.Make note in the Notes column of any birds flushed by the approach in case they do not return during the count.Stand quietly at plot center for 5 minutes before starting the count. This is essential to allow any disturbance caused by the approach to settle down.Use this 5-minute settle-down time to fill out the information at the top of the data sheet.Record in the Notes column any unusual circumstances around the plot. such as construction activity. or if a substantial part of the view is blocked. such as by a wall.CONDUCTING THE COUNTAfter the 5-minute settle-down period. set a watch or timer and conduct the count for 15 minutes. Rotate slowly in place and record all birds seen or heard. For each observation. note the following in the appropriate column of the data sheet.SpeciesUse the AOU code (7th Edition) if known. or write down the complete common name.If the species can not be positively identified. use the closest taxonomic affiliation. (It is better to record something as unknown rather than guessing.)Number of Individuals and DistanceUsually. a single individual bird will be recorded per line.Only record a number greater than one on a single line if birds of the same species are observed very close together. such as a flock or family group.If a mixed flock is observed. put each species on a separate line and note in the Notes column that they were part of a mixed flock.Record estimated flock sizes. only if you cannot count them all. in the following manner: 10-20 or 15+.Write the number of individuals observed in the appropriate distance columns (a meter - 39 inches - is a little bit longer than a yard.)If a bird moves during the count. record only the distance at which it was first observed.Try to be aware of bird movement to minimize counting birds twice.Fly-Throughs (FT)If a bird is seen flying through the count area. below the tallest structure or vegetation. but not observed taking off or landing. record it in the FT column only. not the distance columns. Note also the direction the bird was first observed.Higher flying birds can be noted in the Notes column if it is likely they are aerial screeners using the habitat. such as a hawk circling 100 feet overhead.You may note in the Notes column any unusual fly-overs. such as a flock of Sandhill Cranes.Seen (S) or Heard (H) ColumnsRecord with a check mark whether the bird was identified from sight or sound. or both. Use caution with similar-sounding birds. like Juncos and White-crowned Sparrows. or with mimics and imitators. like Grackles and Starlings.DirectionRecord the direction the bird was first observed. or heard. This may mean recording a bird heard to the south (S) even though you were facing northwest (N/W) at the time.Use the cardinal and midcardinal points of the compass (N. N/E. E. S/E. S. S/W. W. N/W) in this column.ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONSWear drab clothing and avoid bold patterns that might scare away some birds. or attract other ones.Do not pish. squeak. or use any other methods to encourage birds to show themselves. This would artificially inflate the bird densities recorded and invalidate the data collected.If the 15-minute count is interrupted for more than 30 seconds for any reason. such as a homeowner coming up to ask what you are doing. make a note of the interruption in the Notes column. An interruption of 5 minutes or more should also be reflected in the End Time column.Do not start or continue a count if personal safety is threatened in any way.

These five tidal rivers have a total surface area of 2.601 km2 or 11% of the total Province area. Small estuarine systems are defined as systems having surface areas less than 260 km2 but greater than or equal to 2.6 km2 . There were 144 small estuarine systems with a total surface area of 4.875 km2 or 21% of the Province.Sampling sites in the large estuarine class were selected using a randomly placed systematic grid (Holland 1990. Paul et al. 1992). The distance between the systematically spaced sampling points on the grid was approximately 18 km. The grid is an extension of the systematic EMAP grid (Overton et al. 1991). The center points of the grids are the sample sites. A linear analog of the systematic grid was used for site selection in the large tidal rivers (Holland 1990. Paul et al. 1992). The grid was used to define the spine of the five large tidal rivers. with a starting point at the river mouth. The first transect was randomly located between river kilometer 0 and 25. Additional transects were then placed every 25 km up the river to the head of tide. The 144 small estuarine systems were randomly selected from the entire list of small systems in the Province (Holland 1990. Paul et al. 1992). They were ordered from north to south by combining adjacent estuaries into groups of four. One estuary was selected randomly from each group without replacement for each of the four years of sampling. The location of the sample within each selected small system was randomly placed. Application of the sampling design to the three estuarine resource classes resulted in 446 potential sampling sites; however. 21 were unsampleable due to inadequate water depth or inaccessibility. so 425 sites were sampled over the four-year period (Fig. D1).b. Permanent plots: Not applicable.c. Data collection frequency: An index period (July?September) was chosen for estuarine sampling to represent that portion of the year when the measured ecological parameters are expected to show the maximum response to pollutant stress (Connell and Miller 1984. Sprague 1985); dissolved oxygen concentrations are lowest (Officer et al. 1984. USEPA 1984); fauna and flora are most abundant; and within-season variability is expected to be minimized. The Virginian Province survey was conducted annually. during the index period from 1990 through 1993. Generally. each station was visited once. Base Sampling Sites (BSS) are the probability-based sites that form the core of the monitoring design and are the basis of this data paper. Crews sampled 425 base stations during the index period over four years.4. Research methods: An important aspect of the EMAP Virginian Province project was that the data were collected and processed with consistent methods. Field methods are documented in the Field Operations and Safety Manual (Reifsteck et al. 1993). Laboratory methods are given in the EMAP-Estuaries Laboratory Methods Manual (USEPA 1995). A performance-based approach was used for chemical analyses. consistent with the approach used by the NOAA National Status & Trends Program (Valette-Silver 1992). All sampling was conducted from small (24-ft) vessels. except for fish sampling at deep-water stations (> 25m). which were collected from larger vessels.a. Field/laboratory: Water column profiles for water quality parameters were collected using a SeaBird SBE-25 Sea Logger CTD. The unit was equipped with probes to measure salinity. temperature. depth. pH. dissolved oxygen (DO). light transmission. fluorescence. and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Water quality measurements were collected upon arrival at a sampling station; no effort was made to standardize for the time of day or stage of tide. The CTD was equilibrated at the sea surface. then lowered through the water column until reaching a depth of one meter above the bottom where the CTD was allowed to equilibrate again. The unit was then returned to the surface. where data were downloaded to an on-board computer for review and storage. If the CTD cast appeared unusual or failed quality control criteria. the cast was repeated. Beginning in 1991. a bottom water sample was collected. and the dissolved oxygen concentration determined with a YSI Model 58 DO meter. This measurement served as a check on the CTD probe as well as a back-up in case the CTD failed.Three benthic samples. if possible. were collected using a stainless steel. Young-modified van Veen grab that sampled a surface area of 440 cm2. A small core (2-cm diameter) was collected from each grab for sediment grain size. The remaining sample was sieved through a 0.5-mm screen using a backwash technique that minimized damage to soft-bodied animals. Samples were preserved in 10% formalin-rose bengal solution and stored for at least 30 days prior to processing to assure proper fixation. In the laboratory. macrobenthic community samples were transferred from formalin to an ethanol solution and sorted. Biomass was measured for key taxa and all other taxa were grouped according to taxonomic type.Fish were collected by trawling with a 15-m. high-rise otter trawl with a 2.5-cm mesh cod end. The net was towed for 10 minutes against the tide between 0.5 and 1.5 m/s (1?3 knots). All fish caught in the trawl were identified to species and counted; up to 30 individuals of a species from each collection were measured to the nearest millimeter. Individuals collected in standard trawls were inspected for gross external pathological disorders at all stations where fish were collected. This included checking body surface and fins for lumps. growths. ulcers. and fin erosion. Specimens with observed gross pathologies were preserved in Dietrich's solution for subsequent laboratory verification and histological examination.An additional 6?10 sediment grabs at each station were taken for sediment chemistry and toxicity analyses. The top 2 cm of sediment was removed from each grab using a stainless steel spoon and thoroughly homogenized in a stainless steel pot. Sediment for chemistry analyses was placed in clean glass jars with Teflon liners or polypropylene containers (for organic and metals analyses. respectively). shipped on ice. and stored frozen in the laboratory prior to analysis for contaminants. Sediments were analyzed for 24 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). 18 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners. DDTs. 11 chlorinated pesticides. butyl tins. and 15 metals. The chemical analyte list is the same as used in the NOAA NS&T Program (NOAA 1992). An additional aliquot was placed in a small polyethylene bag and refrigerated for grain size analysis. The remainder of the composite sample (> 3.000 mL) was placed in a clean plastic jar for sediment toxicity testing.Toxicity tests were performed on the composite sediment samples from each station using the standard 10-day acute test method (USEPA 1994. USEPA 1995) and the tube-dwelling amphipod Ampelisca abdita. Amphipods were exposed to sediment from the site for 10 d under static conditions in 1-L glass test chambers. Five replicates per station were tested with 20 amphipods per replicate. A performance control was run with each test. as was a water-only test using a reference toxicant (Cu or sodium dodecyl sulfate) to evaluate the condition of the test organisms. Eighty-five percent survival in the sediment control was required for a test to be valid. To normalize for test conditions and amphipod health. survival among treatments is expressed as percent of control survival.Further descriptions of the methods used are given in the Near Coastal Program Plan (Holland 1990). the Virginian Province Implementation Plan (Schimmel 1990). the 1993 Virginian Province Field Operations and Safety Manual (Reifsteck et al. 1993). and the EMAP-Estuaries Laboratory Methods Manual (USEPA 1995).b.

Large estuarine systems are defined as systems having surface areas greater than 260 km2 and aspect ratios (length/average width) less than 18. Twelve large estuarine systems with a total surface area of 16.097 km2 or 68% of the Province's estuarine area met these criteria.

In previous studies the Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program has developed an integrated approach of paleoecological and historical reconstruction meteorological modeling air photo interpretation GIS analyses and field studies of vegetation and soils to address fundamental ecological questions concerning the rates direction and causes of vegetation change to evaluate controls over modern species and community distributions and landscape patterns and to provide critical background for conservation and restoration planning. In the current study we extend this approach to investigate the link between landscape history and the abundance distribution and dynamics of species communities and landscapes of the Cape Cod to Long Island coastal region including the islands of Martha's Vineyard Nantucket and Block Island. The study region includes many areas of high conservation priority that are linked geographically historically and ecologically. Despite the compelling rationale for examining this coastal region as a whole and for comparing its related though distinctive geographic areas an integrated and comprehensive study of the region has never been undertaken.We are investigating regional controls over landscape patterns and community distribution and will focus in detail on the dynamics of sandplain communities including grasslands heathlands barrens and woodlands which are unique components of this region and high priorities for conservation. In order to determine the historical and modern abundance and distribution of these community types and to relate these to historical patterns of land use fire windstorms and other disturbances we are developing: (1) GIS-based spatially explicit maps of land use land cover environment hurricane characteristics and cultural features across the region for the historical period (17th C to present) (2) pollen and charcoal diagrams for critical areas where data are currently unavailable and an integrated analysis of data from all studies across this region (3) analysis of the relationship between high priority communities (sandplain grasslands heathlands barrens and related communities) rare species and disturbance history (4) revised conceptual ecological models for sandplain communities and recommendations for ecological goals and management approaches.Methods:Species List - The data file lists all taxa recorded in the sample plots. Taxonomy follows Gleason and Cronquist (1991). In general codes are formed by taking the first four letters of the genus name and the first three letters of the species name. Where this causes confusion an eight letter code unique to each taxon is used.Plot Locations  - Plots are identified by a general location code (2-3 letters) and a plot number (1-999). These two identifiers are also combined into a single six-character code. Because the plots were sampled from a larger set of potential plot locations plot numbers are not necessarily sequential. Total number of plots = 776 (270 in 1999 389 in 2000 117 in 2001).Soil Chemistry - For plots sampled in 1999 (CJ series) the two pairs of 0-15 and 15-30 cm samples were subsampled (1/8 cup per sample) and combined to make a single composite sample representing the plot which was then sent to Brookside Labs. For plots sampled in 2000 only one set of 0-15 and 15-30 cm samples was collected and ? cup of each was mixed to produce a composite 0-30 cm sample sent for analysis. In some samples concentrations of certain cations were below the detection limit of the analytical equipment; in these cases concentrations are listed as ?less than x ppm.? Before the soils data can be analyzed quantitatively these entries will need to be replaced by numerical values. There are no lab soils data for two plots sampled in 2000 (MT 50 and PB 14).Plant Cover - Cover of all vascular plant species rooted within the 20 x 20 m plot (also total lichen and bryophyte cover) was estimated on an eight-point scale.Tree Diameters - Diameters of all live trees at least 2.5 cm dbh and all standing dead stems at least 10 cm dbh were measured in all plots. Only truly arboreal species were measured; shrubs such as scrub oak and viburnum were not although individuals of these species routinely exceeded 2.5 cm dbh.Tree Cores - One to three cores of the largest sound trees were sampled in plots with trees greater than 5 cm dbh. Cores were taken at 30 cm above the ground. Most cores were mounted sanded and counted under a hand lens or microscope. Some cores of young trees were counted in the field and not collected Tree plots data in Southern New England Coast New York Coast (1999-2001) Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",Plots,,1.

Consider if 1965 data should be included with the rest of the data because this data was for live trees > = 1.5 cm dbh whereas the remaining inventories considered all trees >=10 cm dbh4. The protocol has changed between years and there is indication that For surveys prior to 2002 (when stems where first tagged) it is not possible to compare the data between sampling years on a plot by plot basis since trees were not individually tagged and plot corners have shifted slightly over time. (?) With the addition of tree tags in 2002 tracking of individual trees is now possible. Subsequent surveys of tagged trees allow for corrections to be made.5.

Sampling was usually done on a biweekly schedule during the open water period and at least once through the ice at the deepest region of each lake. although in some years lakes Waubesa and Kegonsa were only sampled monthly during the open-water period. On a few dates during high winds or during winter. sampling was conducted in slightly shallower water than at the deepest lake location. Tow depths for Mendota and Monona are included in the data set. Tow depths for Waubesa and Kegonsa have not been transcribed yet. but generally ranged between 9.5-10.0 meters and 7.5-8.0 meters. respectively. The conical zooplankton net had a 15-cm diameter opening (small net) and a net filtering area to opening area ratio of about 11. The net was made of Nitex screening with a mesh size of 75-80 um (#20 net) for all years except for 1976 when the mesh size was about 153 um (#10 net). The smaller-meshed net was initially chosen so that rotifers would be quantitatively collected along with crustacean zooplankton. For the small net. a vertical tow sample was taken from approximately 0.5 m off the lake bottom. The net was pulled to the lake surface at approximately 0.3 m per sec. After the net was raised and the sides rinsed. the sample was transferred to a bottle and preserved with formalin in early years. sugared formalin for a few years. and then formalin plus seltzer water was the preservative used after 1986. For each zooplankton sample obtained by the small net. organisms were identified to species and enumerated in three separate 1-mL subsamples obtained by a Hensen-Stemple pipette. Subsamples were taken directly from the sample bottle (sample volume ca. 150-250 mL). transferred to a 1-mL Sedgewick-Rafter cell and counted using a compound microscope. For each subsample. individual body lengths for all Daphnia encountered were recorded using an eyepiece micrometer; 5-10 organisms of other cladocerans and various life stages of copepods (i.e.. nauplii. copepidites. and adults) were also measured. Based on specified size criteria. juvenile and adult Daphnia of each species were recorded separately. These size criteria were given in Luecke et al. (1990) for samples collected in 1976-1989. The criteria varied in subsequent years but were generally 1.3 mm for D. pulicaria. 1.2 mm for D. mendotae. the most common Daphnia species encountered. If smaller Daphnia were encountered with eggs in their brood chamber. then the adult size was adjusted. Thus. the distinction of adult versus juvenile Daphnia densities recorded in each sample must be viewed as only an index of the two age groups. Calanoid and cyclopoid copepodites were counted separately as two distinct groups without regard to species or life stages. All nauplii were counted as a single group with no distinction made between calanoid and cyclopoid species. All densities and length measurements in the three subsamples were then averaged for each species' life stage. Numerical density estimates (N per meter squared) for each species or zooplankton group as reported in the data set were then computed by multiplying the average subsample count by the subsampling dilution factor (i.e.. volume of sample in bottle) and then dividing by the net opening area (0.01767 meter squared). Biomass estimates for each species or zooplankton group (gram per meter squared) can then be computed using the average length (mm) recorded in the data set using length-weight relationships published in the literature. One caveat for interpreting the zooplankton data for 1976-1994 is that the net efficiency of the vertical tow net used is less than 100%. and also variable depending on the amount of algae clogging the net (Lathrop 1998). Under clear water conditions (Secchi disc greater than 8 m). the net efficiency of the small net was determined to be approximately 58%. However. net efficiency was only about 42% during a period with moderate blue-green algal densities (Secchi disc 1.8 m). The relatively small mesh size (75-80 um) of the net was initially chosen in order to capture rotifers. which are recorded in the database. Beginning in 1991 a larger 30-cm diameter (large) net with a 75-80 um mesh size was also used. which became the standard sampling net used in 1995 coincident with the lake sampling program being conducted by the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research (NTL-LTER) Project. After 1994. the small net was no longer used for sampling zooplankton on the Yahara lakes. This data set also contains large net data for years 1991 through 1994 for Mendota and for 1994 for Monona. Leptodora counts from the small net are available for Mendota (1976-1989). Monona (1976-1987). Kegonsa and Waubesa (1976-1985). Leptodora counts from the large net are available for Mendota (1991-1993). All Leptodora counts were performed on the entire sample by dumping the sample bottle into a container. Individual length measurements for some zooplankton sampled with the small net are available for Mendota (1988-1989. 1992-1994) and Monona (1994). Individual length measurements for zooplankton sampled with the large net are available for Mendota (1991-1993). Daphnia eggs counts (number of eggs per adult daphnia in the sample) from samples taken with the small net are included for Mendota (1976-1991). Monona (1976-1993 except 1989). and Kegonsa and Waubesa (1976-1985). Egg counts represent the combined number of free eggs found in each subsample plus eggs still remaining in adult Daphnia as many times adult Daphnia had eggs expelled from their brood chambers once the preservative was added (especially in years when the preservative was just formalin). Once the total number of eggs for either D. pulicaria or D. mendotae was counted. then the estimate of the number of eggs per adult Daphnia was calculated while recognizing that the criteria for separating adult versus juvenile Daphnia is not without error. Thus. the number of eggs per adult number is best used as an index to determine if the Daphnia population was increasing or not growing due to food limitation.

We take one vertical tow with a Wisconsin Net (80um mesh) and a series of Schindler Patalas (53um mesh) samples spanning the water column. All samples are preserved in cold 95percent EtOH.After collection we combine subsamples of the individual Schindler Patalas trap samples to create one hypsometrically pooled sample for each lakeordate. The individual depth samples are discarded after pooling except from one August sampling date per year. The Hypsometrically Pooled sample and the Wisconsin Net sample are archived in the UW Zoology museum.We count zooplankton in one or two subsamples each representing 1.8L of lake water of the hypsometrically pooled samples to calculate zooplankton abundance. We count one sample date per month from the open water season and the February ice cover sample.  We identify individuals to genus or species take length measurements and count eggs and embryos.Protocol log:  1981-May1984 -- a 0.5m high 31L Schindler Patalas trap with 80um mesh net was used.

Excel spreadsheets are used for data entry and file names should begin with the overall study (npp) followed by the date (mm.dd.yy) and the initials of the recorder (.abc). Finally the site abbreviation should be added (i.e. c g b p). The final format should be as follows: npp.mm.dd.yy.abcg.xls. File names should be in lowercase.A 1-m2 PVC-frame is placed over the fiberglass stakes that mark the diagonal corners of each quadrat. When measuring cover it is important to stay centered over the vegetation in the quadrat to prevent errors caused by angle of view (parallax). Each PVC-frame is divided into 100 squares with nylon string. The dimensions of each square are 10cm x 10cm and represent 1 percent of the total area.The cover (area) and height of each individual live (green) vegetative unit that falls within the one square meter quadrat is measured. A vegetative unit consists of an individual size class (as defined by a unique cover and height) of a particular species within a quadrat. Cover is quantified by counting the number of 10cm x 10cm squares filled by each vegetative unit.Niners and plexidecs are additional tools that help accurately determine the cover a vegetative unit. A niner is a small hand-held PVC frame that can be used to measure canopies. Like the larger PVC frame it is divided into 10cm x 10cm squares each square representing 1% of the total cover. However there are only nine squares within the frame hence the name ?niner.? A plexidec can help determine the cover of vegetative units with covers less than 1%. Plexidecs are clear plastic squares that are held above vegetation. Each plexidec represents a cover of 0.5% and has smaller dimensions etched onto the surface that correspond to 0.01% 0.05% 0.1% and 0.25% cover.It is extremely important that cover and height measurements remain consistent over time to ensure that regressions based on this data remain valid. Field crew members should calibrate with each other to ensure that observer bias does not influence data collection.Cover Measurements:Grasses-To determine the cover of a grass clump envision a perimeter around the central mass or densest portion of the plant excluding individual long leaves wispy ends or more open upper regions of the plant. Live foliage is frequently mixed with dead foliage in grass clumps and this must be kept in mind during measurement as our goal is to measure only plant biomass for the current season. In general recently dead foliage is yellow and dead foliage is gray. Within reason try to include only yellow or green portions of the plant in cover measurement while excluding portions of the plant that are gray. This is particularly important for measurements made in the winter when there is little or no green foliage present. In winter sometimes measurements will be based mainly on yellow foliage. Stoloniferous stems of grasses that are not rooted should be ignored. If a stem is rooted it should be recorded as a separate observation from the parent plant.Forbs-The cover of forbs is measured as the perimeter of the densest portion of the plant. If the forb is an annual it is acceptable to include the inflorescence in this measurement. If the forb is a perennial do not include the inflorescence as part of the cover measurement. Measure all foliage that was produced during the current season including any recently dead (yellow) foliage. Avoid measuring gray foliage that died in a previous season.Cacti-For cacti that consist of a series of pads or jointed stems (Opuntia phaecantha Opuntia imbricata) measure the length and width of each pad to the nearest cm instead of cover and height. Cacti that occur as a dense ball/clump of stems (Opuntia leptocaulis) are measured using the same protocol as shrubs. Pincushion or hedgehog cacti (Escobaria vivipara Schlerocactus intertextus Echinocereus fendleri) that occur as single (or clustered) cylindrical stems are measured as a single cover.Yuccas-Make separate observations for the leaves and caudex (thick basal stem). Break the observations into sections of leaves that are approximately the same height and record the cover as the perimeter around this group of leaf blades. The caudex is measured as a single cover. The thick leaves of yuccas make it difficult to make a cover measurement by centering yourself over the caudex of the plant. The cover of the caudex may be estimated by holding a niner next to it or using a tape measure to measure to approximate the area.Height Measurements:Height is recorded as a whole number in centimeters. All heights are vertical heights but they are not necessarily perpendicular to the ground if the ground is sloping.Annual grasses and all forbs-Measure the height from the base of the plant to the top of the inflorescence (if present). Otherwise measure to the top of the green foliage.Perennial grasses-Measure the height from the base of the plant to the top of the live green foliage. Do not include the inflorescence in the height measurement. The presence of live green foliage may be difficult to see in the winter. Check carefully at the base of the plant for the presence of green foliage. If none is found it may be necessary to pull the leaf sheaths off of several plants outside the quadrat. From this you may be able to make some observations about where green foliage is likely to occur.Perennial shrub and sub-shrubs-Measure the height from the base of the green foliage to the top of the green foliage ignoring all bare stems. Do not measure to the ground unless the foliage reaches the ground.Plants rooted outside but hanging into a quadrat-Do not measure the height from the ground. Measure only the height of the portion of the plant that is within the quadrat.Foliage canopy cover:Cover and height are recorded for all separate vegetative units that fall within an infinite vertical column that is defined by the inside edge of the PVC-frame. A vegetative unit consists of an individual species with a unique cover and height. This includes vegetation that is rooted outside of the frame but has foliage that extends into the vertical column defined by the PVC-frame.As mentioned above cover is quantified by counting the number or fraction of 10 cm x 10 cm squares intercepted by each vegetative unit. It is possible to obtain a total percent cover greater than 100 for a quadrat because vegetative units often overlap (especially in shrubs and succulents). For perennial plants cover is based only on the vegetative portion of the plant (stem and leaf). For annual plants cover is based on both vegetative and reproductive (inflorescence) portions of the plant.If the cover of a vegetative unit is less than 1 the increments used are as follows: 0.01 0.05 0.1 0.25 0.5 and 0.75. If cover is between 1 and 5 increments of 0.5 are used and if greater than 5 increments of 1 are used.  Finally if the cover is greater than 15 the total canopy cover is divided into smaller units and the cover and heights of each observation measured separately. This reduces the size of harvest samples.

Net primary production is a fundamental ecological variable that quantifies rates of carbon consumption and fixation. Estimates of NPP are important in understanding energy flow at a community level as well as spatial and temporal responses to a range of ecological processes.Above-ground net primary production is the change in plant biomass represented by stems flowers fruit and and foliage over time and incoporates growth as well as loss to death and decomposition. To measure this change the vegetation variables in this dataset including species composition and the cover and height of individuals are sampled twice yearly (spring and fall) at permanent 1m x 1m plots within each site. A third sampling at Site C is performed in the winter. The data from these plots is used to build regressions correlating biomass and volume via weights of select harvested species obtained in SEV157 Net Primary Productivity (NPP) Weight Data. This biomass data is included in SEV182 Seasonal Biomass and Seasonal and Annual NPP for Core Research Sites.Methods: Locating the Sampling Quadrats: Site P the pinon-juniper woodland site (Cerro Montosa) is set-up differently than the other core sites. In order to accommodate the different habitat types groups of transects (i.e. plots) were set up along north (N) and south (S) facing slopes as well as along vegas (V) and ridges (R). Transects on the first two plots consist of 40 quads each (10 quadrants for each of four habitat types). Plot one is slightly west of plot three and plot two is slightly west of the weather station. Plot three is located on a wide piedmont which consists of four transects with five quadrats on each.Collecting the Data: Net primary production data is collected twice each year spring and fall for all sites. The Five Points Creosote Core Site is also sampled in winter. Spring measurements are taken in April or May when shrubs and spring annuals have reached peak biomass. Fall measurements are taken in either September or October when summer annuals have reached peak biomass but prior to killing frosts. Winter measurements are taken in February before the onset of spring growth.Vegetation data is collected on a palm top computer. A 1-m2 PVC-frame is placed over the fiberglass stakes that mark the diagonal corners of each quadrat. When measuring cover it is important to stay centered over the vegetation in the quadrat to prevent errors caused by angle of view (parallax).

Stoloniferous stems of grasses that are not rooted should be ignored. If a stem is rooted it should be recorded as a separate observation from the parent plant.Forbs shrubs and sub-shrubs (non-creosote)-The cover of forbs shrubs and sub-shrubs is measured as the horizontal area of the plant. If the species is an annual it is acceptable to include the inflorescence in this measurement if it increases cover. If the species is a perennial do not include the inflorescence as part of the cover measurement. Measure all foliage that was produced during the current season including any recently dead (yellow) foliage. Avoid measuring gray foliage that died in a previous season.Cacti-For cacti that consist of a series of pads or jointed stems (Opuntia phaecantha Opuntia imbricata) measure the length and width of each pad to the nearest cm instead of cover and height.

Do not measure to the ground unless the foliage reaches the ground.Plants rooted outside but hanging into a quadrat-Do not measure the height from the ground. Measure only the height of the portion of the plant that is within the quadrat. Creosote Measurements: To measure creosote (i.e. Larrea tridenta) break the observations into two categories:1.) Small individual clusters of foliage on a branch (i.e. branch systems): Measure the horizontal cover of each live (i.e. green) foliage cluster ignoring small open spaces (keeping in mind the 15% guideline stated above). Then measure the vertical height of each cluster from the top of the foliage to a plane created by extending a line horizontally from the bottom of the foliage. Each individual foliage cluster within a bush is considered a separate observation.2.) Stems: Measure the length of each stem from the base to the beginning of live (i.e. green) foliage. Calculate the cumulative total of all stem measurements. This value is entered under height with the species as stem for each quadrat containing creosote. All other variable receive a default entry of 1 for creosote stem measurements.Do not measure dead stems or areas of dead foliage. If in doubt about whether a stem is alive scrape the stem with your fingernail and check for the presence of green cambium.Recording the Data: Excel spreadsheets are used for data entry and file names should begin with the overall study (npp) followed by the date (mm.dd.yy) and the initials of the recorder (.abc). Finally the site abbreviation should be added (i.e. c g b p). The final format for sites B G and C should be as follows: npp_core.mm.dd.yy.abc.xls.

After having been submitted to logging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries followed by a major fire in 1923 the forest is currently in a transition state dominated by pioneer canopy tree species. The sampling design is based on the annual re-sampling of 43 permanent 400-m2 plots along five transects running parallel to an elevation gradient from a lake (Lac Croche) to the top of a hill. Abundances of all understory vascular plants (tree seedlings herbs and shrubs) are included in the data set and are expressed either as absolute densities or cover classes depending on life form. The location and elevation of each plot as well as some key environmenatl descriptors such as slope rockiness canopy openness age of the largest tree basal area of mature trees and a number of soil variables are also available. The Lac Croche data set should prove useful for testing hypotheses about forest vegetation dynamics at different sacles as well as to test new statistical tools developed for the analysis of the spatio-temporal variation of plant distributions. Sampling is ongoing and new data will be added every year   ________    Site description: The study site is located within the SBL (Fig. 1) which is located north of Montr?al in St-Hippolyte Qu?bec Canada. The SBL was acquired in 1963 by the D?partement des Sciences biologiques (Universit? de Montr?al) as a long-term research facility. Located at the foot of the Laurentides geological formation (part of the Canadian Shield) it is part of the sugar maple - yellow birch ecological region. The territory is mostly forested with several lakes and bogs typical of the region. The SBL (46?58? ? 46?01?N 73?57? - 74?01?W) covers 16.5 km2 of mountainous irregular ground with much evidence of the Wisconsinian glaciation (e.g. erratic boulders). Bedrock is primarily composed of anorthosite. Altitude varies from 270m to 450m. Mean annual temperature is 3.9?C and annual precipitations average 1153 mm of which 26% falls as snow (1970-2000 averages; SIMAT 2000). While the climax forest type on mesic sites in the region is typically Acer saccharum - Betula alleghaniensis forest a large number of mesic sites are currently in transition states that are dominated by A. rubrum and pioneer tree species such as B. papyrifera and Populus grandidentata (Savage 2001). This is likely due to perturbations such as logging episodes early in the 19th and 20th century as well as a fire which occurred in 1923 (Lortie 1979). Conifers are dominant on hydric and xeric sites. On August 1st 2006 a windstorm with 100 km/h winds created gaps in the canopy where patches of large pioneer species were still present.Sampling design: The data were collected during a plant ecology field course (BIO3753) given each summer in mid-August by the D?partement de sciences biologiques Universit? de Montr?al. Five permanent transects were established in 1998 at the north-eastern tip of Lac Croche (Fig. 1). Transects are separated by about 50 m. The transects which run more or less parallel to each other at an azimuth of 074? start at the edge of the lake and follow an elevation gradient uphill. Along the transects 43 permanent plots were established (1998) approximately every 50 m. Their location is marked by permanent steel rods in their center. Plots are 20 ? 20 m (400 m2). Sampling of the Lac Croche transects takes approximately three days to complete; the dates given in the data set is that of the first sampling day each year.Within each plot the cover of herbaceous and shrub species was assessed every year usinga modified Braun-Blanquet (1932)semi-quantitative cover scale (Table 1) (Barbour et al. 1999). Tree seedlings (DBH < 1 cm) were also inventoried within two classes according to height (smaller or taller than 30 cm) (Table 2) using ten 1 m x 1 m sub-plots that were established every 2 m along the center of each plot following the transect axis. Within each sub-plot all tree seedlings were counted and identified to species. Data from those ten sub-plots were then pooled and multiplied by 40 to give an estimate of tree seedling abundance over the whole 400 m2 plot. In 1998 2000 and 2001 the two classes of seedlings were joined. Tree seedlings were not inventoried in 1999.A number of abiotic and biotic environmental variables were also evaluated. In 2005 all mature trees (DBH > 10 cm) were identified to species and their diameter at breast height (DBH) measured. The total basal area (BA) per species was then calculated for each plot. A pedon was dug just outside each plot (in order not to disturb the area for subsequent years). From this pedon the following edaphic variables were evaluated: thickness of the organic (O) horizon thickness of horizon A presence of eluviation (E horizon) (Soil Survey Division Staff 1993) and maximum root depth. Pedons were as deep as necessary to collect all variables. Slope was measured using a clinometer (PM-5 model Suunto Vantaa Finland) and slope orientation was measured using a compass. Slope shape was judged on a qualitative scale (concave convex or regular). Surface rockiness (including exposed bedrock) was evaluated on the modified Braun-Blanquet cover scale (Table 1). Canopy openness was measured with Gap Light Analyzer (Frazer et al. 2000) from hemispherical photographs of the canopy taken in the middle of each plot at one meter above ground. Geographic coordinates as well as elevation were measured with a differential GPS receiver (Trimble Navigation Ltd. Sunnyvale CA USA) with estimated 2-m accuracy.

The top 3 recorded species are Rutilus rutilus (27%) Gobio gobio (10%) and Anguilla anguilla (7%).         Sampling Methods: The three sampling methods that were applied in this project (cooling water intertidal and subtidal fykes) proved to be complementary and each are useful to describe a different aspect of the migration of diadromous fishes. The volunteer network (intertidal fykes) has a high temporal and spatial resolution. Especially the catadromous species that use the estuary as a foraging and nursery area were caught in the intertidal fyke nets. Subadult shads and downstream migrating juvenile lampreys were only caught in the cooling water of the powerplant of Doel. In addition the fish monitoring of the cooling water in Doel started in 1991 which allows us to investigate long-term trends. The subtidal fyke nets that were deployed underneath the migration barriers proved to be efficient in catching the fishes during their spawning run. During their upstream migration anadromous fishes accumulate underneath the barriers where they can be caught in large numbers. migration of diadromous fishes data from the river Scheldt Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",Sites,,1.

There was no change inoperation that can result in significant changes in the pumped volume. so the combined water flow wasconstant over years. However. each generator was shut down for maintenance in turn for about onemonth during winter to spring seasons. which causes the combined water flow velocity to decrease 50%.The sample was collected in opportune days in order to avoid sampling during the maintenance period.Over 6.000.000 m3 of water. taken from the near-shore waters off northeastern Taiwan. was used monthlyby these two nuclear power plants.The intake of the first plant was built on a straighter shoreline than that of the second plant. which islocated in an open bay along the Yehliu Cape.

The main site used was Shackelton Point. Because one site (Billington Bay) was only sampled some years. it is notincluded in the weekly average table. This table averages data taken from five sites (Shackelton Point. Buoy 109. 117 and 125. andThree Mile Bay) collected during the same sampling week.

On a small number of occasions. a sampling was conducted on a Friday to Sunday for the followingweek. The net used was a 153-um mesh nylon net (0.5 m diameter) towed vertically from 0.5 m off the sediment surface to the watersurface. The efficiency of the net was measured with flow meters from 1999 to present. If flow meter readings indicate a malfunctionor human error (efficiencies below 50% and above 125%) and when no flow meter was used. we assumed an efficiency of 87.4%(average of the 1999 to 2010 sampling period 87.4% SD 9.5%.

Purpose A summary of why the data was collected.For thirty years. the Marine Resources Research Institute (MRRI) at the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR). through the Marine Resources Monitoring. Assessment and Prediction (MARMAP) program. has conducted fisheries-independent research on groundfish. reef fish. ichthyoplankton. and coastal pelagic fishes within the region between Cape Lookout. North Carolina. and Ft Pierce. Florida. The overall mission of the program has been to determine distribution. relative abundance. and critical habitat of economically and ecologically important fishes of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB). and to relate these features to environmental factors and exploitation activities. Research toward fulfilling these goals has included trawl surveys (from 6-350 m depth); ichthyoplankton surveys; location and mapping of reef habitat; sampling of reefs throughout the SAB; life history and population studies of priority species; tagging studies of commercially important species and special studies directed at specific management problems in the region. Survey work has also provided a monitoring program that has allowed the standardized sampling of fish populations over time and development of an historical base for future comparisons of long-term trends.Annual MARMAP cruises to assess relative abundance of reef fishes in the sponge-coral and shelf edge (live bottom) habitats of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) have been conducted since 1978. MARMAP currently samples natural live bottom habitat from Cape Lookout. NC to the Ft. Pierce area. FL. The current main MARMAP objectives are to:(1) Sample reef fishes in the snapper-grouper complex at using a variety of gears in live bottom. rocky outcrop. high relief. and mud bottom habitats.(2) Collect detailed data for time series description of species for annual composition and relative abundance.(3) Obtain population characteristics on fish species of interest through life history information analysis. including age and growth. sex ratio. size and age of sexual maturation and transition. spawning season. fecundity. and diet. Priorities are dictated by the SEDAR schedule and other management considerations.(4) Collect hydrographic data (e.g. depth. temperature. salinity. etc.) for comparison to fish abundance and composition indices.(5) Collect DNA samples from selected fish species for stock identification.(6) Expand sampling area in North Carolina and south Florida as well as reconnoiter new live bottom areas with underwater video (UWTV) to add to the MARMAP site database.

Big Muskellunge. Crystal. Sparkling. and Trout lakes and bog lakes 27-02 [Crystal Bog]. and 12-15 [Trout Bog]) at two to nine depths using a 2 m long Schindler Patalas trap (53um mesh) and with vertical tows (1 m above the bottom of the lake to the surface) using a Wisconsin net (80um mesh). Zooplankton samples are preserved in buffered formalin (up until the year 2000) or 80% ethanol (2001 onwards) and archived. Data are summed over sex and stage and integrated volumetrically over the water column to provide a lake-wide estimate of organisms per liter for each species. A minimum of 5 samples per lake-year are identified and counted. Sampling Frequency: fortnightly during ice-free season - every 6 weeks during ice-covered season Number of sites: 7   -------- Methods: Sample Collection: Schindler-Patalas TrapFor LTER lakes use the 2-meter high. 45L Schindler-Patalas trap with 53um mesh net and cup. The volume of the trap used should be indicated on the Volume by Weight form.Collect samples from the target depths at the deep sampling station in each lake. Sample depths are measured from the middle of the trap.Target Depths:TR: 1. 3. 5. 7. 9. 15. 20. 27. 31 metersCRorBM: 1. 3. 5. 7. 9. 11. 13. 15. 18 metersSP: 1. 3. 5. 7. 9. 11. 13. 15. 17 metersALorTB: 1. 3. 6 metersCB: 1 meterTake samples starting at the surface and working down. Lower the trap slowly so that it remains vertical in the water. Pause at the target depth long enough to allow both trap doors to close completely. and check when it reaches the surface that both did close. Drain the trap through the net and cup. swirling the cup until the liquid level is below the mesh windows. Remove the cup from the net and pull out the center pin to drain the sample into jar. then rinse cup and pin several times with 95percent EtOH into the sample jar.Sample Collection: Wisconsin NetLower the net to the bottom sample depth. Pull it up slowly. at a rate of about 3 seconds per meter. A slow haul prevents the net from pushing water and plankton away from the mouth of the net. Drain the cup until the water level is below the lower window. then pour contents into the sample jar. Rinse the cup with 95percent EtOH several times. adding the rinse to the sample jar.Hypsometric PoolingRationale and DefinitionIn March 1986 the LTER Zooplankton Group decided to pool the discrete depth Schindler Patalas trap samples into one pooled sample per lake-date for counting. Counting pooled samples rather than all of the depth samples reduces the time to produce zooplankton count data. The group hoped to count pooled samples from the entire backlog of uncounted samples and eventually to count samples shortly after collection.Samples are pooled considering lake hypsometry and. therefore. represent the entire lake. Previously. unpooled samples (2-9 samples per lake-date) or samples pooled considering only a water column were counted. Hypsometric pooling allows us to consider the zooplankton community as representing the entire lake. as our other limnological methods do. instead of just a column of water.Lake hypsometry is a three dimensional image of a lake or basin. In a simplified example of hypsometry. a lake is similar to a cone filled with water. If the cone were divided into three layers by two equidistant horizontal planes. the volumes in those layers would be very different from each other. The uppermost layer would contain the most water. Similarly. the upper depths typically contain most of the volume of a lake.Pooling is the creation of a new sample from subsamples of the Schindler trap samples collected from one lake-date. The volume of each subsample used to make the pooled sample reflects the depth range the sample represents and the volume of water that range represents relative to the entire lake volume. Samples pooled in this manner are called HP samples. for hypsometrically pooled. and are referred to as volume weighted because the volume of lake water each depth sample represents determines the subsample size.In sum. the advantages to this method of pooling are quicker turnover time and representation of the entire lake in a volume weighted fashion. Disadvantages of this method include the time required to pool subsamples. errors introduced during pooling. and the loss of more specific depth information.Pooling ProcedureAllow the sample jars to air dry for a day or two. Weigh the Wisconsin Net sample and record the weight on the Volume by Weight form. Mark the liquid level on the jar with a Sharpee brand permanent marker.Add 95percent EtOH to each Schindler trap sample to bring liquid volume up to a weight of 105g. measured by weighing the sample jar with lid on the balance. If sample jars already contain more than 105g of liquid. allow some of the volume to evaporate in the hood. and then bring up to 105g. Record the final weight of jar plus sample plus EtOH on the Volume by Weight form.Calculate the subsample volumes. called target volumes. using the hypsometric table for each lake. Record these volumes on the Volume by Weight form.Mix the first sample gently and thoroughly by tilting the jar from side to side. Measure the target volume into a plastic graduated cylinder. Pour the subsample quickly and smoothly because the plankton settle out quite rapidly. Choose the smallest size graduated cylinder that can measure the target volume in one aliquot. Add the subsample to the labeled HP jar. Repeat with all other depth samples. When all of the subsamples have been added to the HP sample. rinse each graduated cylinder into the HP jar with several small volumes of EtOH.Place the HP sample in the hood to evaporate the excess volume of EtOH. The final weight of the HP sample should be 105g. Mark the liquid level on the jar with a Sharpee brand permanent marker. If the samples are from the August quarterly. pour the remainder of each Schindler sample into a labeled jar for archival. For all other sample dates. discard what is left of the Schindler samples. Rinse and air dry the field sample jars.Sample Storage and Record KeepingStore samples in cardboard records boxes obtained from UW Stores. storing samples from each lake in a separate box. Approximately one year of samples will fit in one box. Fill out the forms for each sample and sample box. as noted below.Box Inventory Form: A record of box contents. It remains in the sample storage box.Volume by Weight Form: A record of samples collected for any one lake-date and their volumes. storage box number. and history of sample usage. Filed in 3-ring binders. one copy at the Zoology Museum and one copy with Corinna Gries.Samples Stored Form: A record of all samples collected and storage box number for each. Current forms are kept in a binder at Trout Lake; archived forms are kept in the UW Zoology Museum. The data are eventually entered into the electronic LTER Museum Catalog.When boxes become full. check the contents against the Inventory Form and Samples Stored Form. and transfer them to the sample storage room in the garage. LTER samples and related paperwork are eventually transferred to the Zoology Museum at UW-Madison.Zooplankton CountingBefore removing a subsample from any zooplankton sample jar. weigh the sample to check for evaporation. If the weight is within 0.1 gram of the last weight recorded on the Volume by Weight sheet. no fluid replacement is necessary. If the weight is more than 0.1 gram low. add 95percent EtOH to the sample to bring it up to the correct volume.Mix the sample well by turning the jar on its side and tipping back and forth gently. We use a Hensen-Stempel pipet with a 5-ml plunger for subsampling zooplankton samples. After mixing the sample. take the subsample as quickly as possible to avoid biasing the subsample as organisms begin to sink. There should be no air bubbles inside the Hensen-Stempel pipet. If there are. replace the subsample into the jar. completely dry the pipet. and begin again with the mixing. When you have a bubble-free subsample. dry the outside of the pipet and dispense the subsample into a cup with 53 mesh bottom. Rinse the pipet into the cup with RO water. and continue rinsing the sample in the cup. washing the ethanol out of the sample through the mesh. Rinse the subsample into the counting tray with RO water. washing the mesh thoroughly to transfer all organisms into the tray.After removing subsample(s) from the jar. weigh the sample jar. and record this weight in a new column of the Volume by Weight form. Record the balance used. your initials. and the date at the top of the column. and add a column header such as Column C minus subsamples removed for counting . Do not put the subsample back into the sample jar after counting. Mark the new liquid level on the jar with a permanent marker. Replace the sample jar into the proper storage box.Count copepods and cladocerans first. identifying individuals to species wherever possible. and staging all copepodids. Measure a subset of each species. Then add a few drops of Lugol s solution to the subsample to stain it. and count the rotifers and nauplii. Count two subsamples for copepods and cladocerans. Count one subsample for rotifers and nauplii. If there are less than 100 of the dominant rotifer in one subsample. count a second subsample for rotifers and nauplii. Add milli-RO water to the tray as necessary to keep the surface of the subsample level. If the surface becomes concave as the subsample evaporates. it is difficult to focus clearly. and measurements may become distorted.Count all eggs attached to any species. For copepods and cladocerans. keep track of the number of individuals with eggs as well as the total number of eggs. Total number of eggs is sufficient for rotifers.Measurements are done as follows: Measure copepods from the tip of the head to the end of the urosome. excluding the caudal rami. Measure cladocerans from the tip of the head to the posterior of the carapace. excluding tailspine. However. measure helmeted Daphnia species from the anterior edge of the eye to the posterior of the carapace.Rotifers are not routinely measured. but where they have been. the total body length excluding spines is measured. Body width rather than length is measured for Conochilus. Conochiloides. and Collotheca.Describe. measure. and draw any unknown species on a separate sheet of paper. If possible. take a photograph of the unknown.All records from 1981-1989 were modified in March 2015 to correct an error in how density had been calculated. Density values in many cases are significantly reduced. Densities are contained in three database tables. The original data is in dbmaker.zoop_raw; an intermediate table is dbmaker.zoop_all_density; and the final table (the one this website extracts density from) is dbmaker.zoop_allnl_summary_snap. Density values are modified from the original to final tables as they are summed or averaged over other variables (sample depth. replicate. and sex stage). The table that was corrected in this case is dbmaker.zoop_all_density. The correction algorithm is as follows: Records from dbmaker.zoop_raw are first grouped to isolate each unique 3-tuple of lake. sample date. and species. Each group is subsequently treated independently. Multiplying the fields 'hp_factor' and 'no_per_l' results in a density value for that record. Density values are then summed within each unique replicate (sex stage is what varies within a replicate). These resultant sums are then averaged over all replicates. giving a density value for each lake. sample date. species. and depth combination. The result is written into field 'number_per_liter' in table dbmaker.zoop_all_density. Densities are subsequently summed over depth before being provided via the website. Records after 1989 were already valid and did not require any modification. Zooplankton density (pooled samples per lake) collected in 4 North Temperate Lakes.

Monona. Wingra. Fish) have been collected for analysis by LTER since 1995 (1996 Wingra. Fish) when the southern Wisconsin lakes were added to the North Temperate Lakes LTER project. Samples are collected as a composite whole-water sample and are preserved in gluteraldehyde. Composite sample depths are 0-8 meters for Lake Mendota (to conform to samples collected and analyzed since 1990 for a UW/DNR food web research study). and 0-2 meters for the other three lakes. A tube sampler is used for the 0-8 m Lake Mendota samples; samples for the other lakes are obtained by collecting water at 1-meter intervals using a Kemmerer water sampler and compositing the samples in a bucket. Samples are taken in the deep hole region of each lake at the same time and location as other limnological sampling. Phytoplankton samples are analyzed by PhycoTech. Inc.. a private lab specializing in phytoplankton analyses (see data protocol for procedures). Samples for Wingra and Fish lakes are archived but not routinely counted. Permanent slide mounts (3 per sample) are prepared for all analyzed Mendota and Monona samples as well as 6 samples per year for Wingra and Fish; the slide mounts are archived at the University of Wisconsin - Madison Zoology Museum. Phytoplankton are identified to species using an inverted microscope (Utermohl technique) and are reported as natural unit (i.e.. colonies. filaments. or single cells) densities per mL. cell densities per mL. and algal biovolume densities per mL. Multiple entries for the same species on the same date may be due to different variants or vegetative states - (e.g.. colonial or attached vs. free cell.) Biovolumes for individual cells of each species are determined during the counting procedure by obtaining cell measurements needed to calculate volumes for geometric solids (e.g.. cylinders. spheres. truncated cones) corresponding to actual cell shapes. Biovolume concentrations are then computed by mulitplying the average cell biovolume by the cell densities in the water sample. Note that one million cubicMicrometers of biovolume PerMilliliter of water are equal to a biovolume concentration of one cubicMillimeterPerMilliliter. Assuming a cell density equal to water. a cubicMillimeterPerMilliliter of biovolume converts to a biomass concentration of one milligramPerLiter.

U.S. Forest Service personnel established 246 0.2-acre (809 m2) continuous forest inventory (CFI) plots on a 2  5 chain (40.2  100.6 m) grid (2 chain spacing on north-south lines) over the entire RNA (Fig. 2). Plot centers were marked with steel pipes. Stems >5 in (12.7 cm) diameter at 1.4 m height (diameter at breast height. DBH) were tallied by species in 1-inch (2.54 cm) diameter classes for most plots (n = 236). In 1948. alternate plots along N-S lines were censused in the same manner (n = 123).In 19741980. under the direction of Dr. Frederick Metzger of the U.S. Forest Service. all CFI plots were recensused. with all woody stems >0.5 in (1.27 cm) DBH recorded by species and DBH to nearest 0.1 inch using Biltmore 'cruising sticks' (Frederick Metzger. personal communication). Standing dead stems > 10 in (25.4 cm) DBH and with bark intact were also recorded. but probably not consistently (see below). Data for three plots have not been relocated (n = 243). Active Forest Service research at the RNA was suspended following closure of the Forest Service Northern Hardwoods Laboratory in Marquette. MI in the early 1980s. Some species. occurring primarily as large shrubs. may not have been consistently recorded (Acer spicatum. Alnus sp. Amelanchier sp. Cornus sp. Corylus cornuta).Beginning in 1989 and continuing over the next several years. I initiated remeasurements. initially for upland plots only. For upland plots (n = 134). all woody stems > 5 cm DBH were measured to nearest 0.1 cm and mapped in polar coordinates from the plot center. Smaller stems were similarly mapped and measured in a central sub-plot 8 m in radius: in 1989 the minimum size for recording stems in the sub-plot was 3 cm; in 1992. minimum size was 2.5 cm; for all subsequent years all stems > 1 cm DBH were included. In 19891992. distances were measured using tapes and azimuth using Suunto site-through compasses; from 1993 onward. distances were measured using Sonin ultrasonic rangers. Subsequently. woody stems in upland plots have been remeasured and newly established stems mapped and measured at. generally. five-year intervals (three or four measurements for most); since 1999. these plots have been consolidated into two groups sampled at staggered intervals such that the most recent measurements are for 2004 and 2007. For some species of large shrubs (Acer spicatum. Corylus cornuta. Cornus rugosa) stems were tallied without mapping. All dead stems > ca. 20 cm (including down stems and stumps) were included in initial samples of upland plots. Dead stems were identified to species where possible. and rated on an 8-point decay scale (Table 1). and classed as standing. tipped up. or broken (with height of break recorded); DBH was measured or estimated for dead stems where possible (for decay codes of 79. diameter measurements were typically impossible). In subsequent remeasurements of upland plots. stems dying since previous measurements were similarly coded (generally using only the first two grades of the decay scale) where possible (dead smaller stems could not always be relocated); after initial plot measurements. DBH was not recorded for dead stems.Since 1994. with major efforts beginning in 2001. I have remeasured a total of 65 additional plots in wetlands on peat and muck soils. As for upland plots. all stems > 5 cm DBH were measured for the entire plot and stems from 15 cm for an 8-m radius sub-plot. but stems were not mapped in these stands.

Sampling was usually done on a biweekly schedule during the open water period and at least once through the ice at the deepest region of each lake. although in some years lakes Waubesa and Kegonsa were only sampled monthly during the open-water period. On a few dates during high winds or during winter. sampling was conducted in slightly shallower water than at the deepest lake location. Tow depths for Mendota and Monona are included in the data set. Tow depths for Waubesa and Kegonsa have not been transcribed yet. but generally ranged between 9.5-10.0 meters and 7.5-8.0 meters. respectively. The conical zooplankton net had a 15-cm diameter opening (small net) and a net filtering area to opening area ratio of about 11. The net was made of Nitex screening with a mesh size of 75-80 um (#20 net) for all years except for 1976 when the mesh size was about 153 um (#10 net). The smaller-meshed net was initially chosen so that rotifers would be quantitatively collected along with crustacean zooplankton. For the small net. a vertical tow sample was taken from approximately 0.5 m off the lake bottom. The net was pulled to the lake surface at approximately 0.3 m per sec. After the net was raised and the sides rinsed. the sample was transferred to a bottle and preserved with formalin in early years. sugared formalin for a few years. and then formalin plus seltzer water was the preservative used after 1986. For each zooplankton sample obtained by the small net. organisms were identified to species and enumerated in three separate 1-mL subsamples obtained by a Hensen-Stemple pipette. Subsamples were taken directly from the sample bottle (sample volume ca. 150-250 mL). transferred to a 1-mL Sedgewick-Rafter cell and counted using a compound microscope. For each subsample. individual body lengths for all Daphnia encountered were recorded using an eyepiece micrometer; 5-10 organisms of other cladocerans and various life stages of copepods (i.e.. nauplii. copepidites. and adults) were also measured. Based on specified size criteria. juvenile and adult Daphnia of each species were recorded separately. These size criteria were given in Luecke et al. (1990) for samples collected in 1976-1989. The criteria varied in subsequent years but were generally 1.3 mm for D. pulicaria. 1.2 mm for D. mendotae. the most common Daphnia species encountered. If smaller Daphnia were encountered with eggs in their brood chamber. then the adult size was adjusted. Thus. the distinction of adult versus juvenile Daphnia densities recorded in each sample must be viewed as only an index of the two age groups. Calanoid and cyclopoid copepodites were counted separately as two distinct groups without regard to species or life stages. All nauplii were counted as a single group with no distinction made between calanoid and cyclopoid species. All densities and length measurements in the three subsamples were then averaged for each species' life stage. Numerical density estimates (N per meter squared) for each species or zooplankton group as reported in the data set were then computed by multiplying the average subsample count by the subsampling dilution factor (i.e.. volume of sample in bottle) and then dividing by the net opening area (0.01767 meter squared). Biomass estimates for each species or zooplankton group (gram per meter squared) can then be computed using the average length (mm) recorded in the data set using length-weight relationships published in the literature. One caveat for interpreting the zooplankton data for 1976-1994 is that the net efficiency of the vertical tow net used is less than 100%. and also variable depending on the amount of algae clogging the net (Lathrop 1998). Under clear water conditions (Secchi disc greater than 8 m). the net efficiency of the small net was determined to be approximately 58%. However. net efficiency was only about 42% during a period with moderate blue-green algal densities (Secchi disc 1.8 m). The relatively small mesh size (75-80 um) of the net was initially chosen in order to capture rotifers. which are recorded in the database. Beginning in 1991 a larger 30-cm diameter (large) net with a 75-80 um mesh size was also used. which became the standard sampling net used in 1995 coincident with the lake sampling program being conducted by the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research (NTL-LTER) Project. After 1994. the small net was no longer used for sampling zooplankton on the Yahara lakes. This data set also contains large net data for years 1991 through 1994 for Mendota and for 1994 for Monona. Leptodora counts from the small net are available for Mendota (1976-1989). Monona (1976-1987). Kegonsa and Waubesa (1976-1985). Leptodora counts from the large net are available for Mendota (1991-1993). All Leptodora counts were performed on the entire sample by dumping the sample bottle into a container. Individual length measurements for some zooplankton sampled with the small net are available for Mendota (1988-1989. 1992-1994) and Monona (1994). Individual length measurements for zooplankton sampled with the large net are available for Mendota (1991-1993). Daphnia eggs counts (number of eggs per adult daphnia in the sample) from samples taken with the small net are included for Mendota (1976-1991). Monona (1976-1993 except 1989). and Kegonsa and Waubesa (1976-1985). Egg counts represent the combined number of free eggs found in each subsample plus eggs still remaining in adult Daphnia as many times adult Daphnia had eggs expelled from their brood chambers once the preservative was added (especially in years when the preservative was just formalin). Once the total number of eggs for either D. pulicaria or D. mendotae was counted. then the estimate of the number of eggs per adult Daphnia was calculated while recognizing that the criteria for separating adult versus juvenile Daphnia is not without error. Thus. the number of eggs per adult number is best used as an index to determine if the Daphnia population was increasing or not growing due to food limitation.

UPC data are collected at 80 points uniformly positioned within a 1 m wide area centered along each 40 m transect (Figure 1). A diver records all organisms intersecting an imaginary vertical line passing through each point and species percent cover is determined as the fraction of points a species intercepts x 100. A species is only recorded once at a given point even if it intersects the imaginary line multiple times. Using this technique the percent cover of all species combined on a transect can exceed 100%. but the percent cover of any individual species cannot. Species are recorded from top- down as they are encountered and are entered from left to right on the datasheet in such a way that primary space holders occupy the left side of the SP_CODE column. Species growing attached to other organisms are not counted. except those species growing on the ornate tube worm (Diopatra ornata).

Salvelinus.In 1975 an Ekman grab was used to sample stations A to G and 1 to200 from a small boat. These samples were taken by a party fromNorthern Operations . Department of Fisheries and Environment atWhitehorse. Yukon Territory.In 1975 a Petterson grab was used to sample stations 75-005 to75-034 from a small boat. These stations were sampled by a fisheriesgroup from the Arctic Biological Station .In 1975 a dredge of Our design was used t o sample stations 75-570.75-572. and 75-574 from Pandora II.Four stations were occupied by Pisces IV: 74-243 in 1974. and75-337. 75-339. and 75-341 in 1975. These stations were in thevicinity of Herschel Island.Kinds of grabs usedFour kinds of grabs were used in sampling the 102 stations:The Petterson grab (Foerst. Chicago) samples an area of 6.065 m2and has a volume of about 5 liters.The Wildco Ponar grab samples an area of 0.05 m2 and has a volumeof about 7.1 liters.The Wildco Petersen grab samples an area of 0.09 m2 and has a volumeof about 9.7 liters.The Ekman grab samples an area of 0.023 m2 and has a volume of about3.6 liters.Collecting and processing grab samplesThe area sampled by grab at each station varied from 0.23 to0.39 m2. with the exception of stations A to G. which were 0+07 m2.and station 200 which was 0.12 m2. The number of grabs taken ateach station varied with type of grab used. This data can be foundin Table 2. In some instances a substrate sample was taken from onehalf of one grab sample and the remaining portion was discarded.leaving only one half of the grab t o be combined with the other grabsamples from the station.Only adequate grab samples were retained. An adequate sampleis one in which the grab samples the bottom evenly. samples atleast 2 liters of substrate. and is closed when brought to the surface.Depth of penetratlon into the substrate may vary with type of substrate.but at most stations depth of penetration was from 6 to 10 cm.After the collection of a set of grabs from a station. substrateand organisms were washed on a stainless steel screen with a mesh sizeof 0.5 mm. Retained invertebrates and debris were preserved in formalin(1 part formaldehyde with 9 parts water) for transporting to the ArcticBiological Station where they were processed.Processing consists of sorting. identifying. counting and weighingspecimens in each sample.Each sample was sorted by hand using a Wild M5 dissectingmicroscope. Specimens were identified to species in most cases andcounts of specimens for each species were recorded. Speciesidentification was not attempted for a few taxa. such as nematodes.nemerteans. hydroids . and bryozoans. and although several species maybe involved. they were listed by taxon on a collective basis. In asimilar manner sponges. bryozoans. hydroids. and other colonial formswere regarded as one individual . Protozoans were arbitrarily excludedfrom the study. Stations 75-012 to 75-015 (Tables 90 to 93) includefreshwater species which were separated but not identified. Thesespecies were not included in the Beaufort Sea species list (Table 4).After sorting and identification. specimens were dried (dryingoven at 100?C overnight) and weighed on a Sartorius gravimetric balanceto four decimal places. The dry weight excludes tubes and shells. butno effort was made to eliminate gut contents. The calcareous partsof echinoderms and the skeletal parts of sponges are included in thedry weight because of difficulty in separating organic and inorganicparts.Data are presented on a m2 basis (Tables 8-108). For each samplenumber and weight of individuals of each species were multiplied by afactor t o convert sample values to m2 values. As an example. valuesderived from a sample area of 0.25 m2 were multiplied by 4 to obtain them2 values. The factor was rounded off t o the nearest 0.5; thus. afactor of 2.5 (instead of 2.6) was used to multiply values from a samplewith an area of 0-39 m2 in converting t o m2 values. Most species collectedby grab were considered to be representative. and their sample values wereconverted to m2 equivalents in a consistent manner. In a few cases. asindicated. the sample values were used without converting. becauserepresentation of occasionally collected. usually large. epifaunal speciescould not be assessed.Collecting and processing dredgesIn 1975 a dredge of our own design was used to sample the epifaunaat stations 75-570. 75-572. and 75-574. The dredge consisted of ametal frame with a net attached. The net was 1 m wide. 2 m long.and had a mesh size of 5 mm. Too few dredges were taken for thedata to be of general application. Estimates of biomass for theepifaunal component were obtained for only two of the three stations.The dredge haul at station 75-574 was aborted. Collected species fromal 1 three hauls were included in the Beaufort Sea species list (Table 4).Dredge data are presented in Tables 109-111. The estimates includethe weight contribution of some infaunal elements that were collectedby dredge. No attempt was made to determine total biomass of astation . by combining epifaunal and infaunal values. Associated datarelating to the dredge hauls are presented in Table 3. Total valuesare presented in Table 6.Observations from Pisces IVThese comments are related by the senior author.A familiarization dive was made in Pisces IV at station 74-243.located 12 miles northeast of Herschel Island. in 135 m of water on5 Sep 1974. Incident light became extinguished at a depth of 35 m.During the descent a variety of objects were visible in the murkywater; amphipods. copepods. mysids. medusae. ctenophores. and stringsof organic matter. The bottom was level. undisturbed by ice keels.and the sediment was fine without rocks. Visibility was 3-4 m.Small mounds and depressions were evident. but epifauna was sparseand patchy. with concentrations no less than 10 or 15 m apart.. Speciesseen during the dive were: burrowing anemones (Cemanthus ?) . i sopods(Mesidotea) pycnogonids (Nymphon). brittle stars ( Ophiocten aericeumand Gorgonocephalus ) . asteroids (Urasterias lincki. Icasterias panopla.Ctenodiscus crispatus. Solaster papposus) . and a fish (sculpin ?). Nobenthic algae were seen. In one area of about 12 m2 there were oneUraeteriae lincki. one Icasterias panopla. two burrowing anemones . oneSolaster papposus. several pycnogonids. and some scattered Ophioctensericeum. Based on dried specimens at the Arctic Biological Station.the estimated biomass of epifauna within the 12 m2 was about 70 gwhich averages out to 5.7 g m-2.In 1975 three dives were made in Thetis Bay. immediately southof Herschel Island on the 2nd. 3rd. and 4th of September. Originally.it was planned to sample several areas across the shelf of the southernBeaufort Sea in order to determine the contribution of epifauna tototal biomass ; however. ice conditions restricted diving to thethree sitess in Thetis Bay.A metal frame. which was one square meter in size. was held bythe arm of the submersible in front of the viewing port and countsof epifauna. large animals that were seen with the unaided eye. weremade at intermittant stops of the submersible. The metal frame hada diagonal brace. so counts could be made in the whole square or inhalf of the square.The dive at station 75-337 was made in depths of water of 45 t o56 m. Counts of the most abundant species. Ophiocten sericeum. weremade within the whole frame of 1 m . The range of counts was 7-19as observed within 16 frame counts averaging 14.5 Ophioctensericeum m-2. The calculated biomass (dry weight) was 1.64 m-2. OneMesidotea and one Ophiopleura borealis were observed within one of the16 frame counts. The dry weight of each of these was about 1 g. whichaverages about 0.13 g m-2. thus bringing the epifaunal biomass to1.77 g m-2 at this station.The dive at station 75-339 occurred in 20 t o 30 m depth of water.Counts of Mesidotea sp.. the only genus observed within the 34 one-halfm2 frames. were 0-3 m translating into 28 individuals in 17 m2.resulting in an average of 9.65 individuals m-2. Biomass was estimatedt o be 1.86 g m-2. Other species observed. b u t not within the frame.were Urasieriae lincki . Ctenodiscus crispatus. and either Buccinun orNeptunea with its egg mass.The dive at station 75-341 was made in 18 to 22 m of water alongthe ridge separating the basin of Thetis Bay from Herschel Trench.Some incident light reaches the bottom at these depths. Scouring wassevere giving rise to a mosaic of scoured trenches and undisturbed areas.Random frame counts were not attempted at this station. but the distributionof epifauna appeared to be patchy in the undisturbed areas. OneUrasteriae lincki and one Mesidotea sp. were observed in the scours. Inthe undisturbed areas the above species.along with Cerianthus sp..Gersemia rubifomis. Pecten sp. . a sponge. and some hydroids were seen.

The summer RV survey follows a stratified random sampling design (Halliday and Kohler 1971). and includes both hydrographic sampling and sampling of fish and invertebrates using a bottom otter trawl.The bottom trawl survey was originally planned to provide biomass and abundance trends for groundfish residing at depths from about 50 m to 400 m. and was extended to cover depths down to 750 m in 1999.There were changes to the net used and the vessel conducting the survey in 1982 and 1983. From 1970 ? 1981 the RV A.T. Cameron. a side-trawler using the Yankee 36 trawl. was used for the survey. In 1982. the RV Lady Hammond was used. towing a Western IIA trawl. Since 1983. the Alfred Needler has been the primary survey vessel. and the Western IIA trawl has been used in all years. Conversion factors were calculated for net and vessel changes (Fanning 1985).For long-term averages. the most appropriate starting point has been selected for each species. In the case of white hake. biomass plots start in 1970 but the abundance index data only go back to 1982. For silver hake. biomass plots and abundance index data are used starting in 1982. This is in conjunction with the change in the type of trawl. from a Yankee 36 to a Western IIA. as well as more consistent identification of white hake and red hake.In 2010. additional survey tows were completed in deeper water off the shelf edge (750 ? 1.800 m) to investigate species composition and biomass in deeper waters. Catches from these stations are not included in the biomass index estimates. to ensure that comparability with other years is maintained. Distribution plots are included here only for the most abundant species noted at these depths. Tables of the entire catches at these depths are also presented.The survey area has been divided into three zones. based on oceanography and biogeography. Trends are shown for the entire shelf survey area. and also for three separate regions: eastern Scotian Shelf (4VW; strata 440 - 466). western Scotian Shelf (4X East; strata 470 - 481). and Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy (4X West; strata 482 - 495). Differences in patterns of fish abundance and species composition are apparent for these regions during the survey.

These depths are considered separate biogeographic zones and since they have not been sampled in all years. are not included in the long-term biomass index estimates.Plots of the size and distribution of catches are provided for selected species and stratified average catches are compared with past results to provide a general overview of trends in abundance and biomass. For select commercial species where individual fish weights have been collected throughout most of the time series. trends in condition (Fulton?s K: weight/length3) are also included (Ricker 1975).Data are presented for the major commercial species. for species that comprise a large part of the survey catch. and for species where the 2010 catch was either unusually high or low (see also DFO 2011a). The set of species examined to determine if catches in 2010 were unusual was restricted to those where the area occupied exceeded 7.000 square nautical miles (approximately 1/7th of the surveyed area) in 2010. or averaged greater 2 than this in the 1970s. the 1980s or the 1990s. The species examined were restricted in this manner to avoid rare species for which catches display high inter-annual variability.Comparisons of stratified length frequencies for 2009 and 2010 to the long-term mean are also included for major commercial fish species.

Sampling methods:Microplankton abundanceData analysed were collected from 1992 to 2002 at 788 sites. See Fig. 1 and Table 1 for a detailed site description. Seawater samples were collected from different depths (most of them in surface waters) from CTD Niskin bottles. For later microplankton cell counts. it is very important to handle seawater with care. as some organisms are very sensitive to turbulence (Gifford and Caron 2000). Water samples were taken from the Niskin bottle and immediately preserved with 15 % acid-Lugol's iodine solution (Throndsen 1978). Samples were labelled and stored in cold. dark conditions during transportation to the laboratory.NutrientsWe only have in situ nutrients data for AMT cruises. Samples were taken from the underway pumping system between stations. from vertical profiles at each station. or both. However. we only included samples obtained during the daily CTD casts coincident with the microplankton sampling. Water samples from the CTD/Rosette system (SeaBird) were sub-sampled into clean Nalgene bottles. Sample analysis was completed within 3 h of sampling. so no samples were stored.Other variablesFor Chlorophyll. between 200 and 300 mL of sea water from each depth in the water column were sequentially filtered through 0.2 m. 2 m and 20 m polycarbonate filters. Chl a was extracted from filters in 90% acetone at 20C for 12 to 24 hours. Samples were measured on a Turner 10-AU fluorometer calibrated with pure Chl a.Temperature and PAR were obtained either from CTD data or underway records from the ship. For those stations where it was impossible to obtain data. these were retrieved from satellite data.2. AnalysisMicroplankton abundanceMicroplankton identification and cell counts was carried out by Derek S. Harbour at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory using inverted microscopy following the Utermhl technique (Utermhl 1958). The ''Water quality - Guidance standard for routine microscopic surveys of phytoplankton using Utermhl technique'' (BS EN 15204:2006) was followed:Microplankton samples. preserved in Lugol's iodine and formalin. were settled in sedimentation chambers while acclimatized to room temperature. to ensure a random distribution of cells. After this. sample bottles were rotated to help re-suspension and separation. Sub-samples with volumes between 10 and 256 mL were later transferred to plankton settling chambers. A variable area of the chamber bottom was counted under the microscope. The size of that area varies with species and abundance and under some circunstances different species were counted in different settled volumes to obtain consistency and reproducibility in the counts. At least 100 cells of each of the more abundant species were counted. Settlement duration varied between 4h cm-1 for Lugol's iodine and 16 h cm-1 for formaldehyde samples.Once the settling process finished. cells were identified. where possible. to species/genus level and assigned to different functional groups: Flagellates. Heterotrophic flagellates. Diatoms. Coccolithophores. Dinoflagellates. Heterotrophic dinoflagellates. and Ciliates. It should be noted that heterotrophic refers to organisms that do not contain pigments.Abundance data for each species at each station was calculated in cells per mL. Dimensions of individual species were measured in m units using digital measurements and calibrated against an ocular micrometer. Using the corresponding geometric shapes. these measurements were converted to volume using the (Kovala and Larrance 1966) methodology. Once this was done. cell volumes were converted to carbon (pg cell-1) using the formulae of Menden-Deuer and Lessard (2000).Since all the plankton counts were obtained by light inverted microscopy they do not include pico-cyanobacteria. like Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. The database adequately samples the microplankton size range and part of the nanoplankton abundance. small eukaryotes are also too small to be identified to the species level by light-microscopy. The Utermhl technique is restricted to cells larger than 10 m (within the nanoplankton size range). Smaller cells do not settle quantitatively even after Lugol's iodine addition and cells are too small to classify to the species level.NutrientsTo analyse nutrients. a Technicon AAII (four-five channel depending on the cruise) segmented-flow auto-analyser was used. Protocols used were different for each nutrient: phosphate and silicate were analysed as described by Kirkwood (1989). Nitrate and nitrite was analysed using a modified version of Grasshoff's method (Grasshoff 1976). as described by Brewer and Riley (1965). These were measured as nirate plus nitrite. since the nitrate was determined as nitrite using a copper-cadmium reduction column to reduce it to nitrite. We later calculated nitrate as the difference between the nitrite measure and the nitrite plus nitrate measure. Ammonium was measured only in cruise AMT6. The chemical methodology used was the described by (Mantoura and Woodward 1983). All results are presented as mol L-1 of the elements nitrogen. phosphorus and silica.

Until substantial poaching began in 1986. Manyara had the highest mammalian biomass density in any natural ecosystem (Delany and Happold 1979; Drent and Prins 1987). comparable to the system of Queen Elizabeth National Park. Uganda (again dominated by elephant and buffalo) before severe poaching reduced mammal numbers drastically there in the 1970s. Manyara is situated mainly in the Eastern Rift Valley (960 m above sea level) but partly on the Mbulu Plateau (1600 m a.s.l.) and receives an average of 650 mm of rain annually. Most game in the Park is sedentary but wildebeest and Burchell's zebra show extensive migratory movements into the rest of the Masai Ecosystem (Prins 1987). Estimates were obtained from a variety of sources (see Legend of Table 1) of the total number of large herbivores (heavier than 20 kg) within the present Park boundaries during the last 25 years. The species and nomenclature are present in Table 2. Where data were lacking for a particular species for a given year of census. estimates were made on the basis of figures from the previous and subsequent censuses. The obtained estimates were discussed with park rangers who had been working in the Park at the time of the missing value. Published figures (Table 1) were also discussed with these rangers. and on the basis of these and on the warden's reports (1959 through 1973). the published figures for the hippopotamus population in 1961. 1965. 1967. and 1970 were disregarded and a new estimate was used instead. It should be noted that estimates of bush species (viz. black rhinoceros. bushbuck. and to a lesser extent impala. waterbuck. and olive baboon) because of the limited visibility in their habitat. are undoubtedly less reliable than estimates for plains species (viz. Burchell's zebra. wildebeest. and to a lesser degree warthog) or for other large herbivores (African elephant. Cape buffalo. and giraffe; cf. Prins and Weyer-haeuser 1987). The estimates for reedbuck are quite reliable as the wardens paid special attention to their numbers. Consumption was calculated according to the assumption that the herbivores' daily food intake (dry matter) equals 2.5% of their live body weight (Crampton and Harris 1969; Van Soest 1982. Van Wijngaarden 1985). which compares reasonably well with the published data for food intake of East African herbivores (Delany and Happold 1979). For the calculations the average live weights used for the different species are presented in Table 2. Some of the species in Manyara are considered real grazers. others real browsers but many species are mixed feeders (Hofmann 1973). As we are interested in quantifying the consumption of grass and browse in Manyara. the consumption by species falling in the category mixed feeder had to be divided into grass consumption and browse consumption. For this division we used the data from Table 2. The data we present are gross indices of consumption per unit land in the Park. The acreage of the dry land area of the park has varied over time because of changes in the level of Lake Manyara. After periods of heavy rainfall the lake submerged parts of the grasslands and woodlands but during extended droughts the lake receded after which the surfacing shore was again colonized by grasses (Loth and Prins 1986. Prins and Loth 1988). The real land area of the Park in the different census years as calculated from aerial photographs (Loth and Prins 1986) is presented in Table 1. The pressure exerted on the vegetation by the herbivores is assumed to be equal to their consumption. although this ignores the effects of trampling. which can be quite important (cf. Sinclair and Norton-Griffiths 1979). Five groups of herbivores are distinguished in the analyses. viz. buffalo elephant-as-grazer. elephant-as-browser'. other grazers (i.e. hippopotamus. Burchell's zebra. wildebeest. impala. reedbuck. waterbuck. warthog. baboon. and bushbuck) and other browsers (i.e. giraffe. black rhinoceros. baboon. impala. bush- buck. waterbuck. reedbuck. and warthog); the categories are weighted according to body weight and the proportions grass or browse in the diet (Table 2). Mean-square successive difference testing was used to detect whether a time series was randomly distributed around the mean. or not (Wonnacott and Wonnacott 1977). The constancy parameter s. defined as the standard deviation of the base-10 logarithm of population estimates. was used to assess the stability of the population; when s is smaller than approximately 0.3 the population is considered stable (Ostfeld 1988). It is. however. better to speak of constancy (i.e.. lack of change in a numerical parameter) than of stability. as the latter implies that the population returns to a certain state after disturbance (Orians 1975). For the species assemblage we calculated a stability index. following McNaughton (1978). Thus. we defined n as the number of herbivore species (n = 13). i as the interaction term equalling the mean value of significant Spearman rank correlation coefficients (rj) between population numbers (for P<0.05 and for P< 0.01). and c the proportion of all r. values that were significant. The stability index is calculated as i/(nc) 1/2; when the stability index is < 1.0. the system is stable and when the index is > 1.0. the system is not stable. We did not calculate guild size (nc) (McNaughton 1978). as this does not appear to be a valid calculation (Harris 1979; Lawton and Ralliston 1979).

In these core fields four permanent sampling transects were laid out in each field. Fields 22 and 29 have 6 transects but these fields are not generally considered part of the core group. In addition to these core old fields. many other similar abandoned fields exist at Cedar Creek and a subset was also sampled for grasshoppers. For the purpose of the grasshopper sampling these fields have been labeled as supplemental old fields. The supplemental fields did not have permanent transects in them and grasshopper sampling methods were adjusted accordingly. Grasshoppers in 19 core E014 old fields were sampled by sweepnet mid-month from June through September from 1989-2006.  Field 28 was added in 1997 and field 11 was added in 2002. bringing the total core field count to 21. Sampling dates are summarized in Table: Core Old Fields Grasshopper Sampling. fields and dates. In each sampling period. 50 sweeps were taken with a 15-inch muslin sweep net along four 40m transects (labeled G. R. W. Y) near the center of each plot. The total number of sweeps for each field in each sample period was 200. with an annual total of 800 sweeps/field. A sweep consisted of a rapid approximately 2m-long horizontal swing of the net through the vegetation. Sweeps were generally collected between 10am-4pm during a two day period when it had not rained and weather was fair with sunny skies. modest breezes. and temperatures above 70F. The contents for each transect were bagged separately in 1-gallon plastic bag. but counts in this data set are pooled by sampling period.

Pitfall trap grids have been installed at three creosotebush sites. three grassland sites. and three mesquite sites. and two tarbush sites. Each grid consists of 4 x 4 rows of traps at 15 meter intervals. Each pitfall trap is 40 cm deep. and lined with tin can cylinders. A polyethylene funnel is set on a container in each trap. Each trap has a ceramic tile cover which is used to close the trap during non-sampling periods. Traps were opened for two consecutive weeks every month for the period 16 June 1989 to 23 August 1991. For the period post-August 1991. traps were opened for two consecutive weeks quarterly (Feb. May. Aug. Oct). During the summer traps are checked every three days. during the winter they are checked once each week. Lizards are removed from the containers and information is recorded on data sheets. Objectives. Desertification is hypothesized to have altered the spatial and temporal availability of resources required by the biota. Results of desertification on the Jornada include changes to shrub dominated communities and major soil changes. We hypothesize that these shifts in vegetation have changed resources temporally for many of the consumers. If grassland systems respond to rainfall without significant lags. but shrub systems do not. then consumer species should reflect these differences. In addition. shifts from grassland to shrubland results in greater structural heterogeneity of the habitats. We have hypothesized that consumer populations. diversity. and densities of some consumers will be higher in grasslands than in shrublands. Diversity and/or densities are hypothesized to be related to the NPP of the sites. Data will be collected for the duration of the LTER program in order to provide data to test these hypotheses.Protocol for Lizard Pitfalls - OVERVIEW.A grid of 16 pitfall traps is located at each consumer plot. Each trap is 40 cm deep and contains an inner plastic container and funnel. A ceramic tile is placed over each trap. For a 2-week period each sample period. the tiles are raised on one side. and the traps are checked every 3 days in summer and once a week in winter. Individual lizards are taken from the traps. identified. sexed. measured. and weighed. Each lizard was clipped with a unique number using the codes on the diagram on the field data sheets. Toe clipping was done from 1989 to 1995. Starting in March 1995 toe clipping was terminated and lizards were instead marked with a black sharpie marking pen to provide a temporary mark to determine recapture status over a particular 2-week trapping period. A black mark is made posterior to the cloaca on the ventral base of the tail. Trapping grid is a 4x4 with 15 meter interval between traps.I. INTRODUCTION. In conjunction with net primary production studies. consumer and faunal studies are conducted at or near NPP sites using pitfall traps. We use live traps. not employing ethylene glycol or other killing/preservative agents. with traps checked once a week at the minimum. Sampling-with-replacement is used with the lizards but without replacement for the arthropods; thus any released arthropods. when possible. should not be let go in the immediate vicinity of the pitfall grids (Note: separate pitfall traps for arthropods were established in 1995 for LTER-III).Lizard pitfall studies are conducted quarterly over a period of two weeks: in February-March (following winter NPP). in May-June (following spring NPP). in August. and in October-November (following fall NPP). A. LOCATION: Pitfall grids consist of sixteen stations (four rows of four traps) located at the following ll sites (the old code. no longer used. is given in parentheses following each site*): T-WEST (TBA). T-EAST (TBB). M-RABB-A (MDA). M-NORT (formerly M-RABB-C (MDC). moved to M-NORT in 1995). M-WELL (MDB). G-IBPE-C (GLC). G-SUMM (formerly G-IBPE-A (GLA). moved to G-SUMM in 1995) G-BASN (GLB). C-SAND-B (CBB). C-CALI (CBA). and C-GRAV (CBD). Pitfalls formerly located at MB (mixed basin slope NE of weather trailer) and C-SAND-C (CBC) have been closed. No pitfalls are directly associated with the following NPP sites: P-COLL. P-SMAL. P-TOBO (because of flooding potential). T-TAYL. or G-SUMM. The pitfall for C-SAND is located NW of the NPP site (see site map). The location of each trap is marked by a rebar bearing a numbered aluminum tag. * (old codes may still be found in data books and vial labels)B. CONSTRUCTION: The LTER pitfall traps are walled by two large vegetable cans. 6 diameter; size 10 tomato cans (6 lbs. 3 oz. ca. 6 l/2 high) are most common. The ends of the cans are cut out and the cans stacked so that the top of the upper can is nearly flush with the ground. Similar-sized coffee cans may be used; the funnel (see below) should fit the can with little excess space. The collection container is a slightly tapered plastic beverage cup 5 l/2 deep with top diameter of 4 l/2; several small (ca. l/16) holes are drilled in the bottom of each cup to facilitate drainage. A polypropylene funnel with top diameter of 5 l/2 is placed in the cup to seal the trap and prevent escapes; the stem and lower funnel are cut off about 4 below the top. making a lower hole of ca. l l/2- 1 3/4 diameter. The cups are supported on small stones or wooden blocks to raise the top of the funnel nearer the top of the can (it should not be flush); elevation of cups is especially important in poorly drained sites. When not in use. the traps are sealed by a ceramic tile with dirt packed along sides (see procedure below). Trap numbers (l-16) originally were stamped on a small aluminum block fastened to a rebar next to each pit. Many of these blocks are now missing. More recently. sites have been numbered with aluminum tags attached to the rebar. If both the block and tag are missing. the number can be determined by counting from the northeast corner of the grid (l-4 north-south. 5-8 next line south-north. etc.). However. some sites. notably BASN. have a different numbering scheme so always check adjacent trap numbers if unsure.A SITE MAP IS INCLUDED WITH THIS PROTOCOLII. PROCEDURE: Traps are usually opened on a Friday; the tiles are excavated and propped open l to 2 at one end using wooden blocks or stones. Be sure the tile covers the trap as completely as possible. During spring and summer. collections are made the Tuesday and Friday the week after opening and again Tuesday and Friday (close) of the next week. In fall and winter. collections on Fridays are sufficient. Take care to look under the cup; both lizards and arthropods (especially scorpions and crickets) will readily hide there. Any lizards found are carefully grasped (don't grab tail!) and subjected to the measurements detailed in section A below. Be sure to use forceps on venemous arthropods. Note special procedures for juvenile lizards. Before leaving for the field. make certain that you have the bag with measuring equipment (below) and a box with labelled cups (w/lids) for the eleven pitfall sites plus an additional unlabelled cup for each participant. The data book should be on a clipboard which has a list of lizard species codes and identification information affixed. IMPORTANT: the clipboard should also had an updated list of the identification numbers previously used in toe marking for the period prior to 1995. Equipment for processing lizards includes a metric ruler. scales. forceps. plastic bags. black sharpie markers. pencils. and a reptile field guide. The scale is a PESOLA (l00 gram) spring-type; it is expensive so should be kept out of the dirt. Equipment kept in a zippered bag either in FH 117 or 236. The following information is recorded in the Jornada LTER II Lizard Pitfall data book for each lizard:l. Pit number (see above).2. Species code: Lizard species are recorded using a four letter code (first two letters of generic and species names). Cnemidiphorus tigris is thus CNTI. etc.3. Sex: record an M. F. or J (juvenile) for each lizard. The field guide and clipboard information may assist in sexing. which differs in different families.4. Rec.: If individuals have been previously marked with a black.5. sharpie marker. record an R (recapture). Record an N for unmarked adults.6. Markings. Prior to 1995: Toe mark: For newly captured adults. toes are clipped according to the numbering system shown on each page of the data book. Note that the ventral side of the lizard is shown in the diagram. With scissors. clip the first 2 mm or so of the required toes. As lizards have only five toes. numbers 6-9 are not used in the codes. Upon reaching number 6 one should skip to the next availble combination (e.g. HOMA 2046 would skip to 2050; UTST 56 would skip to 100. Close attention should be given to avoid toe clipping errors. It is also imperative that accurate and updated records be kept (on provided clipboard sheet) of numbers used; be sure this sheet is brought to the field each time. Severe problems have occurred in the past with skipped and duplicated numbers. In general. JUVENILES. especially small ones. should not be toe clipped as the required handling may injure them. Put a dash across the toe mark space for small juveniles. After 1995: Each new lizard is marked with a back sharpie marker at the ventral base of the tail posterior to the cloaeca.7. S-V: record length (in mm) from snout apex to vent for each lizard. Exercise great care in handling juveniles for any measurements. Estimates might be better for very small juveniles; the handling needed to position the lizard for measurement may be injurious. If the juvenile is not too active it can be measured in the cup.8. Total length: record total length in mm from snout to tail tip for each lizard.9. Weight: place lizard in plastic bag and clip bag to the scale. Keeping bag out of wind if possible. note weight in grams (subtract bag weight) and record in data book. Very small to small juveniles can be estimated at l gram.10. Tail: record as whole (W) or broken (B). If tail is broken and regrown. record as broken and make a note at the bottom of the page. A SAMPLE LIZARD DATA BOOK PAGE IS INCLUDED WITH THIS PROTOCOL III. CLOSING PITFALLS: on the last day of collections. close the pitfalls by lowering the tiles to the ground surface and covering the pitfall as well as possible. and then packing soil or sand tightly around the edges and top of the tile. Soil on top may discourage coyotes and help assure tight closure. A shovel or trowel is useful in closing the traps. Be sure to place a stone atop the tile or it may be difficult to find the trap again. Sloppily closed pitfalls will be deathtraps for any organisms getting in. so take time to seal them.IV. GENERAL PROBLEMSl. Poor drainage (or flooding) is a problem in several areas. especially tarbush and BASN. If traps and cups are flooded. pour the cup onto a flat surface and try to recover as many organisms as possible (note in book any not kept). Using the cup. bail as much water out of the trap as possible.2. Broken tiles: this has been a problem at the RABB sites which are open to grazing. Tiles from the LTER I transect have been used as replacements. An extra tile is usually kept with the pitfall box and a box of tiles has been kept in the annex.3. Broken funnels: plastic funnels eventually begin to crack and must be replaced. If broken funnels are noticed make a note for immediate replacement. Some funnels are available in the FH236 lab.4. Natural toe loss in lizards may have affected the toe marking system. If new captures had lost toes (usually only one foot will be affected). attempts were made to incorporate the digit into the marking scheme. Toe losses in marked recaptures may be told by reference to the marking lists and should be noted in the data book. 5. Escapees: large. active lizards are easily capable of escaping from one's grip and occasionally from untended traps with the tile off. Beware of lizards running up your arm as you attempt to pull them from traps- a quick grab is safer than slow fishing. If a lizard escapes. note as much information as you can about it and then write escaped across the rest of the row.

The survey route consisted of the same 4-km walk which took approximately four hours (10001400 h). Walking surveys is an  effective and widespread practice for monitoring amphibian and reptile communities (Doan. 2003; Woodford and Meyer. 2003). The route included normal tallgrass prairie habitats. the shorelines of a pond. and intermittent streams. Amphibians and reptiles were detected by turning over rocks and other debris. and by sighting animals in the open. Each year. we recorded the number of individuals of each species encountered. and environmental conditions including: midday air temperature (C). water temperature (C). cloud cover. burn conditions (burned versus unburned). and the presence of flowing water in the intermittent streams (Table 1).  ---- Fourteen herpetofaunal surveys were conducted during a 15-year period (19891990 and 19922003) at Bud Jan Nitschke (BJN) cattle ranch in Cowley County. Kansas (37u159 N. 96u439 W). The 650 ha ranch is located in the southern portion of the Flint Hills. and the vegetation is dominated by a matrix of perennial warm-season C4 grasses. such as big bluestem (A. gerardii). little bluestem (A. scoparius). indiangrass (S. nutans). and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). A diverse mixture of other less abundant species includes warm-season and cool-season grasses. composites. legumes. and other forbs. Woody species such as leadplant (Amorpha canescens).  buckbrush (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). New Jersey tea (Caenothus herbaceous). and smooth sumac (Rhus glabra) are locally common (Freeman and Hulbert. 1985). Average monthly temperature ranges from a low in January (22.7 C) to a high in July (26.6 C). Average annual total precipitation ranges from .750 to 850 mm with 75% falling during a summer growing season (MarchJuly; Bark. 1987). One common characteristic of the region is protruding limestone outcrops on hilltops. which provide suitable habitat for several species of amphibians and reptiles. During the 15-year study. two management practices were implemented at the BJN ranch. Traditional season-long stocking (200 hundred cows with their calves. .0.6 animals/ha) was implemented the first 10 years (19891998) and pastures were burned in alternate years. Starting in 1999. the land management practice switched to intensive-early cattle stocking (approximately 650 yearlings. .1.0 animals/ha. maintained for 3 months starting in late spring) combined with annual burning.

During 19891990 all trees ? 30 cm girth at breast height (gbh) were sampled in five northsouth transects 20 m wide and 180 to 370 m long covering a total area of 3.12 ha. In 19921993 additional rectangular plots were established bringing the area sampled to 5.07 ha in total. In all 3870 trees were identified tagged mapped and provided with permanent dendrometer bands. Since then the sampled area has been regularly censused at 35 year intervals recording tree recruitment mortality and growth. We present data from censuses conducted in 19901993 1994 19971998 20012002 2007 and 2010. These data have been used to study the natural forest dynamics and to calibrate spatially explicit simulation models. ____ Sampling design consists of five northsouth oriented transects viz. A B C D and E each 20 m wide 180 to 370 m long and 100 m apart center to center. The 5 transects were installed in 19891990 and collectively represent a 3.12-ha systematic sample of the forest compartment whose main dendrometric and floristic characteristics are given in Pascal and Plissier (1996). Subsequently additional rectangular sampling plots viz. H R and S which overlap the transects and represent an additional area of 1.95 ha were established in 19901993 to study the dynamics of the forest in particular topographic situations (Plissier 1997 1998). A piece of R source code is given in section III-V-D below to extract data according to various sampling configurations. Table 1 gives a summary of plot size and location. Because of the uneven site topography (see B.1.Watersheds and hydrology) each plot was designed as a grid of 10  10 m contiguous elementary quadrats adjusted to account for local slope angle. The purpose of the correction was to ensure that each side of a quadrat was approximately 10 m flat so that it contains in total a 100 m2 area in planar projection. The slope angle (alpha) was measured along each quadrat sides which length parallel to the ground was adjusted to l = 10/cos(alpha). In order to accurately locate the trees in (xy) co-ordinates within each quadrat they were temporarily delineated with a plastic rope. All trees from 30 cm girth at breast height (gbh) were inventoried measured tagged mapped and identified to species. The point of girth measurement of each tree (pom) was marked with paint in the initial inventory and then fitted with a permanent dendrometer band. For mapping the trees within each quadrat the flat distance from the centre of the trunk base to the nearest quadrat boundary was measured in two perpendicular directions parallel to the rope. Each quadrat was mapped in the field at a scale of 1:100 with indication of tree locations main rocks fallen trees stream courses trails etc. These maps are stored at IFP Botany Lab. Instrumentation: Slope angles were measured with a 1-degree precision using a Suunto hand-held clinometer. Distance measurements were taken with a 1-cm precision thanks to a 20 m fiberglass tape. Initial tree girths were measured at 1.30 m from the ground or above the buttresses with a precision of 0.1 cm using a 3 or 5 m flexible steel tape. A calibrated 1.30 m stick was used to determine pom height. The dendrometer bands were prepared by technical IFP staff using stainless steel bands adjusted to tree girth and equipped with a 1:50 vernier (Hall 1944; Fig. 5) that allows girth to be measured with a theoretical precision of 0.02 cm. The dendrometers were then fitted at pom on the trees and vernier readings taken as initial gbh measurement. Recensuses. Recensuses have been conducted every 35 years in all plots since May 1990 (census 0) in May 1994 (census 1) November 1997April 1998 (census 2) December 2001May 2002 (census 3) April 2007 (census 4) and April 2010 (census 5). Time intervals between censuses are given in Julian day calendar since day 0 on 1st March 1990. However some plots (H extension R and S) installed in March 1992 and November 1993 are included with a census 0 date on day 762 and 1341 respectively. Similarly censuses 2 and 3 which were completed over several field trips refer to more than one Julian date (see Table 1). At each recensus all plots were screened for tree mortality tree growth by girth increments of alive trees reading from dendrometer bands and tree recruitment i.e. those trees attained the girth threshold of 30 cm gbh since the previous census. The recruited trees were tagged mapped identified and installed with a dendrometer band following the initial census protocol (see II.B.3. Research methods). Summary data of plots demography are given in Tables 3 (all plots pooled together) and 4 (tansects A to E pooled together).

Greenhouses and shade houses were annually set up in late May or early June and removed in the end of August or early September. Greenhouses and shade houses were discontinued in 1989. There are 4 replicate blocks each containing 1 replicate of each of the following treatments. Control (CT)Fertilized (NP)Greenhouse (GH)SAMPLING TECHNIQUES: Biomass quadrats size 20x20 cm were taken from Toolik tussock site. Five quadrats were taken from each of four blocks.  All aboveground biomass plus belowground stems and rhizomes were clipped in 20x20 cm quadrats. Normally 4 or 5 quadrats were randomly located along line transects in each of four replicate blocks for each treatment. Aboveground biomass is considered within the quadrat if it is associated with a meristem that is within the quadrat. Quadrats were sorted within 24 hours into species and then into tissue type. Depending on the harvest tissue types can be broad categories i.e. above and below or more detailed i.e. inflorescences new growth old growth etc. They were then dried at 50-70 degrees Celsius in a drying oven. After several days in the oven samples were weighed to nearest milligram. Finally the samples from all quadrats from a transect were combined according to tissue type. For some harvest samples were returned to Marine Biological Lab Woods Hole MA for nutrient analysis. Details are given in Shaver and Chapin (Ecological Monographs 61(1) 1991 pg. 1.) Leaf area was measured in 1995 and 2000 harvest with a LiCor LI-3000A area meter.  Leaf areas for graminoids deciduous and forbs were measured immediately after plucking and before drying.

Surveys were conducted between 04:30 and 08:00 EDT and most were completed by 06:30 EDT. Observers listened quietly for ten minutes at each of five stations. [In 2003 we increased the 5-species point count length from five to ten minutes in order to gather more information and to achieve methodological consistency with the all-species protocols and with Canada?s High-Elevation Landbird Program.]They recorded the number of each focal species seen or heard during three time periods: 0-3 minutes 3-5 minutes and 5-10 minutes. If Bicknell?s Thrush was not detected during or between point counts surveyors returned to each point immediately after the full route survey and broadcast a one-minute recording of the bird?s vocalizations in order to elicit a response from present but silent birds. A two-minute listening period followed each broadcast. [Prior to 2003 the broadcast duration was three minutes.]Audio playbacks were discontinued upon detection of one or more individuals. If no Bicknell?s Thrush responded to the broadcasts the status of the species at that location was classified as unknown. Monitors who completed their surveys without encountering Bicknell?sThrush were asked to conduct follow-up audio playback surveys at dusk or dawn before 15 July (after Atwood et al. 1996). If no observations of Bicknell?s Thrush were made during the second visit the species was presumed to be absent from that site. Site selection was based on a GIS model of potential Bicknell?s Thrush habitat that incorporates elevation. latitude. and forest type (see Lambert et al. 2005). The model depicts conifer-dominated forests above an elevation threshold that drops 81.63 m for every one-degree increase in latitude (-81.63 m/1? latitude). The threshold?s slope corresponds closely with the latitude-elevation relationship for treeline in the Appalachian Mountain chain. which is -83 m/1? latitude (Cogbill and White 1991). Four routes have been established on peaks lying below the elevation threshold. while forty routes cross the threshold due to the limited availability of trails or land area above the threshold. We made an attempt to randomize site selection by randomly assigning priority ranks to discrete units of high-elevation habitat. However. the choice of sites was constrained by the availability of volunteers and the location of existing trails. When placing routes. we favored discrete starting points (e.g. trail junction). extensive conifer stands. and upper elevations. Volunteers establishing a route for the first time placed five points at 200- to 250-m intervals along a mapped course. Monitors submitted a detailed description of each station in order to facilitate its location in future years. 10% quinaldine solution spread throughout the study site to anesthertize fish.

Two of these collections (March and October 1979) were excluded from analyses because a combination of storms and insufficient low tides (-0.15 m) prevented adequate sampling. The remaining 13 collections were made during low tides ranging from -0.24 to -0.46 m. Sampling consisted of spreading a 10% solution of quinaldine (an anesthetic) throughout the study site until fully anesthetized fishes were observed. Specimens were then collected by hand or with dip nets and sampling was terminated after a complete search of the study site failed to yield additional specimens. This included overturning rocks and boulders by hand which were then replaced with minimal disruption. Three investigators have shown that quinaldine collections yield relatively unbiased estimates of the relative abun- dances of fishes in intertidal areas (Gibson 1967b; Grossman 1979; Yoshiyama 1981). Excluding the May 1981 sample where all specimens were identified and returned to the site alive specimens after collection were placed in 10% formalin and identified.

(1994) was applied also during the additional seventeen years. For a recent general description and discussion of the method we refer to Bibby et al. (2000). The method is also called spot mapping? after William (1936) and it is similar to the method used in the Common Bird Census in the UK (Marchant et al. 1990) and the Breeding Bird Census in North America (Robbins 1970). The observer walks slowly through the plot putting down all bird observations in their proper positions on a map paying particular attention to recording simultaneous presence of males in adjacent territories. Species maps are then constructed from the visit map records. The species maps are used to evaluate the number of distinct clusters of records which are believed to represent territories. The method is of course prone to errors both when recording the birds in the field and when evaluating the number of territories from the species maps. Furthermore the number of territories is never stable throughout the breeding season: some birds die some fail to breed successfully and leave their territories and some arrive late and establish new territories. However for our analysis it is not essential to know the exact number of territories in every particular part of every breeding season. Instead standardization (recording birds and evaluating the species maps in the same way every year) is the key to reliable comparisons and we did our best to achieve this. We made ten visits per year in all but two years (nine visits in 2007 and 2009). They were distributed from April through June (always after 9 April and before 18 June) but with variation according to the arrival of spring. All surveys were made by the same person one of the authors (Ann Mari Thorner). Since AMT also carried out all surveys in 1987?1992 there is now a series of no less than twenty-one years with the same observer. This ensures that the new results are comparable with the data from before 1993. Each visit took between two and three hours so the minimum annual survey effort was twenty hours. A cluster of records was accepted as a territory if it contained at least three records (for a few very late arriving species two records was considered sufficient; cf. Svensson 1978). Adjacent clusters were accepted as different territories either if they were distant enough from each other (in relation to typical territory size) to make it likely that they belonged to different males or if they contained simultaneous records (a male recorded in both at the same time). A special study on inter-specific competition with a large number of nest-boxes was conducted in the valley in 1963?1966 (Enemar et al. 1972). The populations of Great Tit Blue Tit and Pied Flycatcher were artificially enhanced these years. We removed the effect of the experiment by reducing the numbers to a proportion equal to the mean proportion in the four years before and the four years after the experiment. The number of Great Tits was reduced from 9 10 19 16 pairs to 6 6 12 10 respectively. The number of Blue Tits was reduced from 6 4 7 5 pairs to 3 2 4 3 pairs. The number of Pied Flycatchers was reduced from 15 18 18 13 pairs to 4 5 5 4 pairs. These modified values are used in all calculations in this paper. Species turnover rate between two different years was calculated by dividing the total of new and lost species with the number of species in year one plus the number of species in year two. This gives the value one hundred percent (that is complete) turnover when no species are common between the two compared years. This is different from the turnover calculation by Enemar et al. (1994) where the sum of new and lost species was divided by the mean number of species in the two years. The latter method gives one hundred percent turnover when half of the species have been lost and replaced with new ones (the methods are identical in principle but give results that differ by a factor of two). In the same way we calculated turnover between two years different number of years apart (from adjacent years to a maximum of fifty-six years apart that is 1953 and 2009). Altogether forty-one small passerine species were recorded as territorial in at least one of the fifty-seven years. Eighteen of these species were keeping territories in all or almost all years (the first eighteen species in Appendix 1 also listed in 33Table 1). These eighteen species are called regular? in this paper. The final twenty-three species of Appendix 1 that is those with zero values in many or almost all years are called non-regular species. Eight of these latter species were recorded in less than four of the fifty-seven years and these species are not at all tested for population change. For the remaining fifteen non-regular and the eighteen regular species we calculated and compared the average number of territories during the first forty and the last seventeen years respectively. The difference between the two periods for the regular species was tested using a two-tailed t-test (Microsoft Excel) and the logarithms of the original values (with a small number of zeros replaced with the value 0.1 to permit calculation of logarithms). The differences for the non-regular species were tested using frequencies namely the number of years with different number of territories (i.e. with 0 1 2 3 and so forth territories). When the number of frequency classes was larger than four frequencies were pooled to form exactly four classes the same ones for both periods giving a 2?4 cell matrix. The Fisher exact test was then applied using the Vassar Stats package (home page of Vassar College Poughkeepsee NY). For the regular species we also calculated the trends across all fifty-seven years using the logarithm of abundance and standard linear regression (Microsoft Excel) also here with zeros replaced with the value 0.1. The same method was used when we calculated trends for parts of the full time series in these species. When calculating correlations between species we used the Spearman rank correlation module of STATISTICA (version 6.1; StatSoft?). All cover values are measured from the vegetation measurement frame which is 1 meter by 1 meter and partitioned into a grid of 100 10 cm by 10 cm squares.

Three rodent trapping webs and four replicate experimental blocks of plots are randomly located at each study site to measure vegetation responses to the exclusion of small mammals. Each block of plots is 96 meters on each side. Each block of plots consists of 4 experimental study plots each occupying 1/4 of each block. The blocks of study plots are all oriented on a site in a X/Y coordinate system with the top to the north. Treatments within each block include one unfenced control plot (Treatment: C) one plot fenced with hardware cloth and poultry wire to exclude rodents and rabbits (Treatment: R) and one plot fenced only with poultry wire to exclude rabbits (Treatment: L). The three treatments were randomly assigned to each of the four possible plots in each block independently and their arrangements differ from block to block. Each of the three plots in a replicate block are separated by 20 meters. Each experimental measurement plot measures 36 meters by 36 meters.

Study area macrofauna sampling and species identification - We used data from twenty-two research cruises (Table 1) from 1991 to 2011 conducted at Sta. M in the North East Pacific (Smith and Druffel 1998). To accommodate the water depth limitations of the remotely operated vehicles Tiburon and Doc Ricketts used during later collections the sampling area was relocated some 40 km between the 1991 and 2005 period (34?50?N 123?00?W c. 4100 m water depth) and the present (35?10?N 122?59?W c. 4000 m water depth; Fig. 1). Macrofauna were sampled with a free-vehicle grab respirometer (FVGR; Smith et al. 2001) a system comprised of four 413-cm2 grabs that collected the top 15 cm of the sediment column (Table 1). After recovery sediment from each grab was sieved through a 300 ?m mesh and preserved in 10% borax-buffered formalin solution. All polychaete specimens recovered from the grab samples were identified to species level using high-power microscopes (Zeiss Discovery v20 Stereo and high power Leica DM 5000 B) published identification keys and original taxonomic descriptions (e.g. Fauchald 1972 Fauchald 1977 and Fauchald and Hancock 1981). Only individuals with a head were considered in the subsequent analyses to give an objective assessment of density and diversity with respect to individual counts (Paterson et al. 2009). Of the 3800 headed-individuals 3646 could be classified to family level and 3077 to species level. Many species appeared to be undescribed and were designated as sp. A sp. B and so forth. Each family was assigned to a single functional group among those defined by Fauchald and Jumars (1979) as detailed in Laguionie-Marchais et al. (2013) and in Table 2. 2.2. Proxies of polychaete biomass and energy use rate. Of the 3077 identified specimens only 100 were complete individuals consequently a proxy of polychaete body volume was employed. The width of the first chaetiger (W1) was measured for all specimens (see Paterson et al. 2006) and cubed as a proxy for individual body mass (=W13). Proxy rates of energy use (respiration R) were then estimated for each specimen using standard mass scaling (e.g. mass3/4 Brown et al. 2004) such that proxy energy use rate R = (W13)3/4 = W12.25. Neither a proportionality coefficient nor a temperature coefficient was applied as in situ temperature was near-constant at Sta. M ( Ruhl et al. 2014).

Study area - The Porcupine Abyssal Plain is situated off the southwest coast of Ireland in the Northeast Atlantic. All the samples were collected between 1989 and 2005. Most samples were taken within a 20 nautical mile (37 km) radius of a central position for time series studies (48?50?N and 16?30?W) (Fig. 1 and Table 1). This site became known as the ?BENGAL Station? following a major European project on seabed biology and geochemistry that focussed its work there (Billett and Rice 2001). The site is now known as the Porcupine Abyssal Plain Sustained Observatory (PAP-SO). The site was chosen to be as far as possible from the influence of the continental slope to the east and the foothills of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the west. The aim was to reduce perturbations caused by slope-related process on the continental margin and the ocean ridge to a minimum. This allowed processes linking the sea surface to the abyssal seabed through the transfer of organic matter to be studied. The seabed depth at the sampling site ranges between 4800 and 4850 m. The site was a level area of seabed with little topographic and environmental heterogeneity. It had a strong seasonal signal in the flux of organic material (phytodetritus) (Billett et al. 1983).  2.2. Sampling - Sampling for megafauna was undertaken using a semi-balloon otter trawl (OTSB14). The wing-end spread was 8.6 m and the net height was approximately 1.5 m from the footrope to the headline. Towing speed was a nominal 0.75 ms?1. The net was constructed of a 44 mm stretch mesh in the main part a 37 mm stretch mesh in the central part and a 13 mm stretch mesh liner in the cod-end. Contact of the net with the seafloor and hence an estimate of the area fished was assessed by changes in wire tension during trawling operations. The acoustic beacon used with trawls between 1989 and 1999 to monitor performance was unavailable from 2000 onwards. We are nevertheless confident that our estimates of seafloor area fished remain consistent throughout the time series. On completion of a trawl samples were sorted into major taxonomic groups on board the ship before being fixed in 5% borax-buffered formaldehyde in seawater. The samples were transferred into 80% methylated spirit once the samples were returned to the laboratory. The samples were then sorted into finer taxonomic groups and wet weight and length was measured for each individual. Apart from sampling at the time series station in the middle of the Porcupine Abyssal Plain a number of other stations were sampled over the years to give spatial relevance (ca. 40?100 nm from PAP-SO). Specific sampling was undertaken deeper than 4800 m to the southeast east and north of the time series station (Fig. 1 Table 1). In addition advantage was taken of other trawling at abyssal depths closer to the base of the continental slope as part of science programmes conducted by the Oceanlab University of Aberdeen and the National Oceanography Centre Southampton. The samples came mainly from close to the mouth of the Porcupine Seabight (Fig. 1). This area had been sampled many times during the IOS Deep-Sea Biology Programme from 1976 to 1989 (Rice et al. 1991). Some of the larger abundant holothurians collected in the trawls namely Psychropotes longicauda O. mutabilis Pseudostichopus villosus and Paroriza prouhoi were enumerated and weighed at sea (fresh wet weight biomass) before the samples were used for other analyses in the years 1998 and 1999. Where this occurred the fresh wet weights were converted to preserved wet weight by applying a factor of 0.6 to the fresh wet weight in order to allow a comparison of wet weight biomass over the whole time series. Conand (1989) has shown that holothurians lose about 40% of their wet weight on preservation.

These transects were typically conducted seasonally but this frequency was variable due to logistical constraints. Linetransect photography was conducted using a Benthos 372 35mm film camera and Benthos 382 strobe mounted on a towed benthic camera sled at a height of 82 cm and 22.5? below horizontal (S1). The camera took photographs approximately every five s as the sled moved along the bottom at roughly 2.8 km h-1 creating a continuous image mosaic of the seafloor with overlapping frames. A semi-balloon otter trawl was towed behind the camera sled to non-quantitatively collect specimens from the line transect area. Collected specimens were then identified and used in part as a voucher collection to identify species in the line-transect photographs. The semi-balloon trawl had a 6.1 m opening and 3.8 cm stretch mesh net with a 1.3 cm mesh cod-end liner (S1). The photographs were evaluated using a Canadian grid system (S2) and the computer program DISTANCE (S3) which was based on line-transect theory (S4). The relative location of each individual along each transect was digitized. DISTANCE estimated the visibility of an object at a distance perpendicular to the centerline of the transect and provided a probability density function and effective strip width (ESW) for each species. The sum of non-overlapping distances between frames along the transect axis provided the transect length. Overlap was estimated by measuring the relative positions of a distinct object in sequential frames. The ESW was multiplied by the transect length to provide an estimation of abundance. When the abundance of any given group was below 15 individuals transect-1 an ESW from a species of similar visibility was used to estimate abundance. Detailed descriptions of the line-transect methodsapplied to the analysis of deep-sea camera sled photographs can be found in the supplemental reference materials (S5 S6).

These are all standard methods of collecting phytoplankton samples 1314 and many are still largely reliant on a phytoplankton manual written in 1978 15. A few samples were collected using automated samplers on moorings 16. The sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. 4. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN. All taxa have been verified as accepted species and given the currently accepted name as defined by the World Register of Marine Species database (WoRMS -http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice). If any taxa could not be verified then a second check was done through AlgaeBase (http://www.algaebase.org/). If this did not verify that taxa as a valid name then the taxonomic level of identification was decreased to a satisfactory level or the entry removed. All abundance values were standardised to cells.L-1 or are given as presence only. Records of the original identifications and units were archived so any records can be checked. Identification of the smaller phytoplankton is often to a coarser taxonomic level as many cannot be distinguished to species using light microscopy. In some studies electron microscopy has been used to determine species but in other studies functional groups have been identified. This data set does not include accessory pigment data which can help resolve these smaller taxa 18 although it can be thought of as a complementary dataset. Over 20 years of pigment data are available in Australia via the AEsOP database (http://aesop.csiro.au/). Cell biovolume is calculated as per Hillebrand et al. 19 following the suggested shape factors for each genera. Size parameters were estimated from measurements taken from Australian samples or Australian references where available420 and other sources where not21-23. In some data sets direct measurements of size classes (e.g. P599 the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and P597 the IMOS National Reference Stations) were used in preference to literature values. For some taxa there was insufficient information available to estimate a biovolume these were generally the rare taxa. Rather than estimate a size class without any information available these have been left blank. _____ Data Records: Each data record represents the abundance or presence of a phytoplankton taxa at a certain point in space and time and has been given a unique record identification number P(project_id)_(sample_id)_(record_id). Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id. The majority of these projects have been uploaded as part of the collation of data for this database. The IMOS National Reference Stations P599 and Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey P597 data which together constitute half the data in this database are available through the AODN (Data citation 12). Table 1 gives summary information on the project data sets their space time and taxonomic resolutions numbers of samples and records available. Users can select data sets from this information and download as desired through the AODN. _____ Technical Validation: The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records. ________ Usage Notes: The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing  more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone. A low cell abundance may indicate a low level or production but this may not be the case if these are large cells. The biomass data helps to show productivity of an area. The biovolume has been calculated for each cell count and when converted to biomass is available for use by modellers and to assist in interpretation of an area?s productivity. An accepted method of converting biovolume to biomass is to assume that the cell has the density of water (1 mm3 .L-1 = 1 mg.L- 1 ) 13. Another useful conversion is to carbon biomass; full methods are readily found in the literature24-26. Table 2 gives details conversions of phytoplankton size data to carbon biomass. Some of the data records are missing dates or coordinates. It was considered useful to keep these records as the presence of a taxa in a location may still be of value. The user may estimate coordinates from the location given and would then also be aware that these wouldnot be the exact coordinates of the sample. Data can be analysed in many different ways and in many software applications (e.g. R Matlab). We include here some figures created in The R Project for Statistical Computing (https://www.r-ptoject.org) to demonstrate some potential uses of the data (Fig 3). In some cases notably project 599 the IMOS National Reference Stations the phytoplankton component of the survey is only a part of the data available. Additional biogeochemical data are available for this data set via the AODN. Some of the projects viz. P479 P599 P597 have corresponding zooplankton data freely available in The Australian Zooplankton Database 27 . These data sets can be matched by the project_id and the sample_id which are consistent across databases.

We live-trapped nocturnal rodents twice each year (spring late summer) on trapping webs in upland prairie (GRASS) and saltbush-dominated (SHRUB) habitats. Three 3.14-ha webs were established in each habitat. Each web had 124 Sherman traps which were spaced 10-m apart on 12 100-m spokes with 30 degrees between spokes. Four traps were set in the center of the web. Traps were set for four consecutive nights in each trapping session. Traps are baited with a mix of peanut butter and oats set in the evening and checked (and closed) at dawn. We recorded sex age and weight upon first capture of all individuals. In the early years of the study individuals were batch-marked (Sharpie colored felt markers) to distinguish recaptures from new individuals providing the minimum information necessary to use distance-sampling methods to estimate density. Most nocturnal species are now usually marked with aluminum ear tags although we continue to mark very small (pocket mice) or small-eared (voles) species only with felt pens. For ear-tagged animals we distinguish new captures (N) from individuals marked during previous sessions (old O) versus those that are recaptured (R) on 2nd 3rd or 4th nights of a trapping session. The location of one trapping web was changed from 13NE (1994-1997) to 13SW (1998- present) because of concerns about intensive cattle use in the pasture as well as activity of CPER Site Manager?s cats. bird abundance calculated from annual censuses on 4 similar transects and bird abundance per km^2 exprapolated from these counts  Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",censuses,,rows with spp names of . or  were removed.

Total number of birds detected on the 8 ha of transects were extrapolated to number per km2 to facilitate comparison with other studies. Annual censuses by the same people were conducted during May each year from plantation age 2 (1977) through plantation age 17 (1992). All birds within a 40-m lateral distance from the transect mid-line detected by sight or sound were plotted on each transect map while each census taker slowly traversed the midline of each transect (Conner and Dickson 1980). Censusing of each transect took from 12 to 20 minutes; the extra time on some plots was used for identifying and recording birds. All censusing was completed within 3 hours after sunrise. Censusing was avoided during high winds (>19 kph) or substantial rain. Neotropical migratory bird abundance and bird species diversity were calculated for all transects each year.

A diver swims the length of the 40 m transect approximately 1m above the bottom at a constant deliberate speed and records all fish passing through the sampling area. Fish size is measured as total length (TL) estimated to the nearest cm. Care is taken by the diver to not count the same individual more than once if it leaves and re-enters the sampling area. Surveys are carried out by only a select number of highly trained divers whose sampling techniques have been standardized in order to minimize observer bias. The horizontal visibility along the transect is measured and recorded for each sampling event. The number of fish taxa sampled is not fixed as all species of reef fish encountered in the sampling area are recorded. Species that are difficult to identify underwater are lumped into broader taxonomic categories (e.g. flatfish in the family Bothidae) to facilitate sampling. Several species of small bottom-dwelling fish are difficult to accurately count and size during the reef fish survey due to their cryptic appearance and behavior. Individuals in a select group of these species are counted and sized in a separate survey done in the four contiguous 20 m x 1 m swaths that centered on the 40 m transect (Figure 1). A diver carefully searches the area within each swath taking time to look on the undersides of ledges and in crevices and within understory vegetation for select species of small cryptic fish which are purposely not counted in the reef fish survey. Understory algae are brushed aside during the search but no organisms or boulders are physically moved. Size is recorded as total length (TL) to the nearest cm.

This method helped to detect density values close to the absolute (Tomia?oj? 1980, Verner 1985) and yield comparable results for different bird species. The accuracy of the method was checked by comparing the results of the census work with the data on bird numbers of intensively observed species (from studies involving individual marking of birds; Weso?owski 1983, 1985, Weso?owski 1987, Piotrowska & Weso?owski 1989, own unpublished data). Most species were registered with a less than 10% field error, but in the case of some other, e.g. Turdus philomelos, Coccothraustes coccothraustes, Ficedula albicollis and probably Regulus regulus, the breeding numbers could be underestimated by 20-33%, particularly, when densities are high (Tomia?oj? 1980, 2004, Tomia?oj? & Lontkowski 1989, Walankiewicz et al. 1997). Hence, some arithmetical corrections would be necessary for careful calculations of the community parameters. Yet, in order to avoid confusion, the data in the tables contain no such corrections.Every year, at least ten visits (sometimes 11-12 to compensate for adverse weather conditions or early onset of spring) were made between (5) 10 April and 25 June to each plot. The observations began before sunrise and proceeded along marked transects 100 m apart on the plots, leaving the transect for minor detours when necessary. Each time a different route across the plot was chosen. Only plot K, the richest in bird species, was subdivided into two parts of c.16 ha each and censused simultaneously by two observers, or by one observer on two consecutive mornings. In order to achieve a high inter-plot comparability, all plots were visited on a rotational basis by all 6-7 observers. Usually, one of the ten visits was performed in the evening for mapping bird species active at dusk. In order to record all singing individuals during the short-lasting activity period of birds in the evening, each (24-30 ha) plot was censused simultaneously by two to four observers. All fieldwork was conducted by experienced fieldworkers and new participants were admitted only after a period of apprenticeship (i.e. after making sure that they were able to gather field data of adequate quality).Data processing All records from field maps were assembled on individual species maps (scale 1:1000) for further evaluation. To assure maximum consistency of the evaluation rules, all estimates of cluster/territory numbers on species maps were checked by at least three experienced people. The final estimate was arrived at after negotiating the (usually minor) differences. When processing the data, it was taken into account that a higher number of double-registrations of the same individuals resulted from our relatively slow progress through the plot. While drawing the ""paper territories"" around the clusters of records, we relied mainly on the presence/absence of contemporary records which helped to avoid an apparent tendency in mobile individuals/species to form double clusters in the place of a single large territory. As a rule, three records were required as a minimum to draw a cluster, with a few exceptions in the case of late arriving, inconspicuous species (e.g. Muscicapa striata, Locustella fluviatilis), and unsuitable weather conditions during valid visits; in such cases only two records of high territorial significance were assumed to indicate the territory. Numerous located nests (especially for Sturnus vulgaris), and behavioural cues demonstrating presence of active nests (carrying nest material or food, alarm calls), were also helpful in deciding on the number of recognised clusters/territories. The territories of polygynous or bachelor males were treated as equivalent to those of monogamous pairs. Compared with the other papers, our species richness estimates may be somewhat higher, because they also included territories of large/rare bird species which were found to occur only partly within the plot boundaries (marked with 0.1 signs in the tables).

This area was censused by the spot map method (Hall 1964) in 1947 (Stewart and Aldrich 1949). In 1948 the members of the Brooks Bird Club began a series of censuses by the spot-mapping method made in early June which have continued to the present at 5-year intervals (DeGarmo 1948 1953; Hall 1958; Hurley 1964; Koch 1968; DeGarmo and Koch 1974; Phillips 1979 1984). In 1959 a program of annual censuses by a rather different index method was begun. The method adopted has the merit of giving a satisfactory index of the number of territorial males in a minimum amount of time-one overnight trip to the area. The index method consists of traversing the length of the study area in a fairly rapid fashion tallying all the birds seen and heard during the traverse. This traverse requires about 12 min to complete. After a wait of about 3 min the area is traversed in the reverse direction. This down-and-back procedure is then repeated giving four traverses of the same route. One set of four is made during the last hour before dark (approximately 19:45-20: 45 EDT) and another set of four is made in the first hour of daylight the next morning (05: 30-06:30). After the evening counts a tentative judgment is made as to the probable number of singing males of each species on the area and at the end of the morning counts final judgment of the population is made. Counts of this nature have been made in the last 2 days of May or the first 2 days of June from 1959 through 1983. All counts through the years were made by the same observer. In the early years the index method counts were not too reliable while the method was being worked out but with added experience the later counts have been good measures of the population. In 1973 1978 and 1983 an additional index method count was made later in June to give some idea of the variation expected by this method. This comparison is given in Table 1. It is noted that most of the rarer species agree exactly but that some of the more numerous species differ by ? I male and the total population varies by ?2 males. In 1983 this variation in the Yellow-rumped Warbler and the Swainsons Thrush may have been due to the arrival of late migrants. In 1964 1968 1973 1978 and 1983 it was possible to compare the index method results with those of the more conventional spot-mapping method (see Tables 2 3 4). For species with small populations the two methods agree quite well but for the abundant species the index method appears to overestimate the population. This happens because this method makes no al- lowances for the fractions of certain territories being outside the boundaries of the study area. The difference is slight for individual species but the accumulated error in the total population is sometimes large. In 1983 when allowances were made for this effect the population estimates agreed almost exactly. The accuracy of the index method is highly sensitive to the weather. Inclement weather on the one day selected for the count can cause large errors. This is the apparent cause of the low count for 1967 made in a cold drizzle on the only 2-day period available that season. mark_recapture Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",mark_recapture,,The species were only given in common name so I changed them to the scientfic name There was no day or month provided  FM biomass and depth given zeroes for NULL values,Aug-16,Count,NA,lat_long_year

Kartzinel,,tylerk@princeton.edu,,CC-by,http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E095/064/metadata.php,Ecology,"Beginning in 2008 a series of three herbivory treatments and a control were randomly assigned to contiguous 1-ha plots replicated three times at each of three sites along a rainfall gradient (36 total plots). Any field experiment entails a trade-off between plot size and replication. Plot sizes of 1 ha are larger than those in many prior large-herbivore-exclusion studies and enabled us to include nine replicates of each plot type which was necessary both to sample multiple sites along the rainfall gradient and to achieve adequate statistical power. And although 1 ha is not large enough to detect all ecological effects of LMH (e.g. seed dispersal numerical responses of smaller LMH to the exclusion of larger LMH) it is adequate to document strong and consistent effects in many individual- population- and community-level responses of plants and small mammals (Goheen et al. 2013) as well as behavioral (as opposed to numerical) responses of smaller LMH to the exclusion of larger LMH (e.g. Young et al. 2005). Total exclosures exclude all large mammalian herbivores (LMH) larger than ~5 kg and ~50-cm tall but are accessible to hares and other small mammals; these exclosures use 2.4-m high fences consisting of 14 strands of wire electrically charged by solar powered batteries with a 1-m tall barrier consisting of 10-cm chain link. Mesoherbivore exclosures consist of 11 wires beginning 30-cm above the ground allowing access to only the smallest LMH (dik-dik Madoqua cavendishi and warthog Phacochoerus africanus) and excluding larger species. Megaherbivore exclosures consist of two wires 2-m above ground level and exclude only megaherbivores (elephants Loxodonta africana and giraffes Giraffa camelopardalis). Open? plots are unfenced and demarcated by a series of 1-m tall wooden posts at 10-m intervals; these plots allow access to all LMH species. On all fences a series of 1-m long wires at 2-m height extend horizontally outward from plots to deter animals that approach the barriers. In January 2009 vertical connecting wires were added to total- and mesoherbivore exclusion fences to increase security and stability. Exclosure plots are regularly inspected and maintained by project personnel. Rapid repairs are made whenever damage to the fencing is discovered. For the eight most common LMH species exclosure effectiveness ranged from 92% (for elephants) to 99% (for warthog and dik-dik; mean effectiveness for all LMH = 96%) during the first 3 years of the experiment (Goheen et al. 2013). Herdsmen for Mpala?s cattle-ranching operation are asked to keep cattle out of the plots. Within each plot a 0.36-ha grid (60 ? 60 m) marked by 49 rebar stakes at 10 m intervals provides a spatial template for much of the experimental monitoring. Small mammals were live trapped at two-month intervals in total-exclusion and open plots using Sherman live-traps (Goheen et al. 2013). In each trapping session and for four consecutive days a single trap was set at each of the 49 grid stakes in the center of each plot opened in the late afternoon and checked and closed in the early morning. All species of small mammals were fit with two fingerling ear tags with the exceptions of individuals in the genera Acomys Crocidura and Mus. These genera are too small or too fragile (Seifert et al. 2012) for ear tags; we instead marked individuals in these genera with black marker for subsequent identification within trapping sessions.

In brief a fixed-route walk (transect) is established at a site and butterflies are recorded along the route on a regular (weekly) basis under reasonable weather conditions for a number of years. Transect routes are chosen to sample evenly the habitat types and management activity on sites. Care is taken in choosing a transect route as it must then remain fixed to enable butterfly sightings to be compared from year to year. Transects are typically about 2-4km long taking between 45 minutes and two hours to walk and are divided into sections corresponding to different habitat or management units.Butterflies are recorded in a fixed width band (typically 5m wide) along the transect each week from the beginning of April until the end of September yielding ideally 26 counts per year. Transect walks are undertaken between 10.45am and 3.45pm and only when weather conditions are suitable for butterfly activity: dry conditions wind speed less than Beaufort scale 5 and temperature 13?C or greater if there is at least 60% sunshine or more than 17?C if overcast. Due to the vagaries of the British and Irish weather it is rare in practice to achieve a full set of 26 weekly counts. However a small number of missing values can be estimated using other counts during the season.Single species (as opposed to normal all species) transects have been increasingly established in recent years. Whilst such transects must follow the standard methodology and must record populations at least once a week throughout the flight period the focus on a single (or small number of) species reduces both the time required to walk each transect and more significantly the number of weekly counts. With many demands on the time of site management staff and volunteer recorders this reduced method has enabled population monitoring of particular threatened butterflies to be undertaken when otherwise it would not have been possible. By regularly recording a fixed route in standardised conditions the number of butterflies seen on a transect can be compared from year to year.

The preliminary list of vertebrate species from Bold Park has already been published (How & Dell 1990). This herpetofaunal survey of Bold Park was undertaken between December 1986 and June 1993 using four similar fenced pitfall traplines. The fenced pitfall traplines consisted of six pitfall traps placed in a linebetween 7 and 8 metres apart. Each pit trap consisted of a 17.5 cm diameter PVC pipe that was 60 cm deep and sealed at the bottom with fly-screen mesh. Drift fences that were 50 m long fly-screen mesh 30 cm high and dug 5 cm into the substrate crossed each of the 6 pitfall traps. Each pitfall trap open for 24 hours was referred to as a pit-day. The four habitats selected for surveying represent the principal vegetation types and most of the vegetational heterogeneity of Bold Park determined by Keighery et al. (1990). These habitats were; ? BP1 Mixed coastal heath ? BP2 Dryandra sessilis shrubland ? BP3 Banksia attenuata / B. menziesii low woodland ? BP4 Eucalyptus gomphocephala (Tuart) woodland.

The surveys were conducted on 66 established sites in the 10000 hectares managed by the Boulder Open Space Department (Bock and Bock 1994). These protected grassland sites are located in a green belt which surrounds the city of Boulder Colorado and include relictual tallgrass prairie lowland hayfields in floodplains and short- and mixed-grass prairies adjacent to foothill woodlands (Bock et al. 1995). These sites should remain free of development in the coming years providing a stable study area ideal for long-term monitoring. The data were used to analyze the effects of habitat characteristics and landscape context on grassland butterfly diversity and abundance (Collinge et al. 2003). The data set represents 7246 individuals of 58 butterfly species in 5 families. These data correspond to a majority of Boulder County grassland butterfly diversity and reflect the phenology of these species for the summer months of the two years sampled (A complete list of all butterfly species found in Boulder County can be found at the USGS Butterflies of North America web site [Opler et al. 1995]). The data set includes endangered butterfly species as well as surveys from rare habitat types (tallgrass prairie). These data are presented with the hope that they improve our understanding of large scale determinants of local and global abundances and diversity. Although these data alone do not constitute a long-term data set (2 years) and the temporal scale is slightly coarse (monthly) by using the standard sampling techniques presented here researchers may generate additional fine-scale (weekly) data to constitute a long-term data set. - Field/Laboratory: In brief we surveyed 66 sites in Boulder County Open Space Grasslands five times over two years: twice in 1999 (July and August) and three times in 2000 (June July August). Sites were sampled on sunny days between 1000 and 1600 hours. We used a modified line-transect method (Pollard 1977) to survey a 200-m-diameter circle (Collinge et al 2003). Each plot was divided into four quadrants of equal area and each quadrant was surveyed for 10 minutes by a trained observer. Beginning 20 paces from the center of the plot an observer walked over the entire area of the quadrant for 10 minutes. The first three to five individuals of each butterfly species observed were collected with butterfly nets and stored in glassine envelopes for the voucher collection. Individuals that could not be immediately identified were collected and identified at the Entomology Collection of the University of Colorado Museum. All butterfly species and their absolute abundance were recorded. Voucher specimens were deposited in the Entomology Collection of the University of Colorado Museum.

Site selection and evaluation: We used a design that allowed for an equal distribution of sampling locations. Spatially-balanced sampling approaches have recently been developed (e.g. Stevens and Olsen 2004 Olsen et al. 2012) that incorporate similar characteristics as random or systematic ones but also guarantee that all samples are evenly distributed across the entire sampling frame (rather than clumping commonly associated with random sampling or distinct intervals associated with systematic sampling). Sites were chosen from Floridas Statewide Seagrass polygon Geographic Information System (GIS) data set compiled by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission-Fish and Wildlife Research Institute Center for Spatial Analysis (FWRI 2007).  We used an Albers Equal Area projection for the shapefile. The file which includes all seagrass coverage across the state of Florida was clipped to include only the Big Bend region from the St. Marks River in the north and the Anclote River in the south. From the clipped polygon we then chose sites using the spsurvey package (Kincaid et al. 2008) in the R software environment (R Development Core Team 2008). We choose a target of100 sites per sampling season (example R code for 2009 site selection provided in BBSG_2009-2010_site_selection_code_2009.txt; see Class V.C.). However because we anticipated that sampling could not be conducted at some sites (e.g. due to lack of target habitat logistical constraints) we also chose additional oversampling sites to replace target sites that had to be dropped from the initial sample. Based on pilot trials conducted in the northern region of our study area during the summer of 2008 we chose a 23% oversample for our 2009 season (100 target + 23 oversample). Based on the 2009 sampling season we chose a 27% oversample in 2010 (100 target + 27 oversample). Ideally sampling would proceed by first visiting all target sites then visiting the required number of oversampled sites to meet the target sample size. However this two-step approach was not possible in the current study given the large area over which sites were located. We therefore visited all oversampled sites as we visited target ones (i.e. we did not back track). Fourteen of the 123 sites that were drawn in 2009 and nine of the 127 sites from 2010 were dropped due to navigational hazards; typically this meant the site was located in a channel used by other boaters was located in extremely shallow water that we were unable to access or trawl or there was a physical barrier such as an oyster bar or shoal that precluded access. The remaining 109 sites from 2009 and 118 sites from 2010 were evaluated for suitable habitat to conduct sampling.Once we arrived at a site we determined whether it could be sampled based on two criteria: (1) it had to include ? 10% seagrass cover and (2) there were no hazards present to the trawl (e.g. due to presence of rocks or other hard substrate) the research vessel or researchers (e.g. due to navigational hazards such as extremely shallow water) or other boaters (e.g. due to presence of other boats anchored or heavy boat traffic). If the site did not meet both criteria we began piloting the research vessel in a spiraling manner around the site location to determine if there was suitable habitat nearby. We continued the spiraling until we had traveled 250 m from the original site (i.e. 500 m diameter circle 196350 m? area around site). If no suitable habitat was found we dropped the site and noted the reason. Among the sites evaluated 91 of the 109 in 2009 and 79 of the 118 in 2010 met the two criteria. The primary reason for a site not meeting both criteria was that it had less than 10% seagrass cover (usually with no seagrass) often with other floral (e.g. attached macroalgae) faunal (e.g. octocorals sponges) or geological characteristics (e.g. rocky reefs) that may have been incorrectly interpreted as seagrass from the aerial photos used to inform the GIS shapefile.B.2. Faunal data collection: If suitable habitat was found either at the site or from our spiraling search we sampled it using beam trawls (mouth opening: 1.87 meter (m) wide by 0.40 m tall; bag dimensions: 19 mm mesh with 3 mm mesh liner) towed on both sides of a 6.1 m research vessel (Fig. 2). Beam trawls were the most appropriate gear for our study for several reasons. First water depths in the region exceeded 5 m at some sites precluding the use of seine nets and drop traps that are commonly used in shallow seagrass beds (Edgar et al. 2001). Additionally we sought to sample across a large area within each site thus requiring a towed trawl gear. Beam trawls are advantageous over otter trawls (which is a commonly used towed gear in seagrass systems) because they retain a constant sampling volume during tows both across sites (otter trawl sampling volume can be affected by bottom substrate which varies across the study region) and within them (otter trawl sampling volume decreases as the net fills because the doors are pulled inward) (Rozas and Minello 1997 Stallings et al. 2014a). Higher and less variable capture efficiencies in beam trawls have also been attributed to the fixed mouth opening (Kuipers et al. 1992). Indeed Zimmerman et al. (1986) demonstrated that beam trawls had markedly higher capture efficiencies of penaeid shrimp (a common seagrass fauna) than seines and otter trawls. Additionally otter trawls tend to ride on top of submerged aquatic vegetation allowing animals to escape underneath the net resulting in low capture efficiency (Leber and Greening 1986 Stallings et al. 2014a). Conversely we demonstrated in pilot trials that the beam trawls remained in contact with the seafloor while being towed at varying depths on different substrates (e.g. soft sand compacted sand) and in different seagrass compositions and areal coverage. We towed the trawls from the sides of the boat (instead of astern) to eliminate problems with prop-wash on catch rates in shallow water. The trawls were towed for 2.5 minutes at a standard rate of 1.8?2.0 km/h (ca. 85 m). This tow speed (based on direct underwater observation) was determined to be the most efficient; faster tows caused the net to ride off the bottom and slower tows allowed animals to escape (personal observation during gear trials). The towing direction was determined a priori with a random number generator from 1-360 (i.e. the heading direction in degrees). However the trawl gears operate most efficiently and safely (i.e. avoiding contact with boat motor propeller) when towed downwind so we adjusted accordingly. The locations of the start and end of each tow were marked in decimal degrees using a Global Positioning System (GPS) which allowed us to measure tow distance and calculate the area sampled.All captured animals were identified to the lowest possible taxon and most were counted and measured in size classes. We did not count or measure the sizes of colonial fauna (e.g. ectoprocts ascidians) the tests of tube worms (e.g. sabellariids) or the shells of worm snails (e.g. vermetids) but we noted their presence. Among the major groups of fauna observed we were able to identify 93.4% of the taxa to species for actinopterygian fishes (92 taxa) 85.2% for bivalves (34 taxa) 85.0% for echinoderms (20 taxa) 76.8% for gastropods (95 taxa) and 70.1% for arthropods (87 taxa). Due to the large quantity of animals that had to be measured we used size classes to expedite the process. Based on previous research using trawl gears in seagrass beds (e.g. Stallings et al. 2010) we used six size classes for the current study: (1) 1-25 mm (2) 26-50 mm (3) 51-75 mm (4) 76-100 mm (5) 101-150 mm (6) ? 151 mm. We measured the total length for teleosts carapace width for crabs post-orbital head length for shrimp diameter for echinoderms and longest plane for molluscs. Once animals were identified counted and measured they were then released back into the water. Care was taken to minimize harm to the animals. Some animals were retained to allow for identification in the laboratory where microscopes and detailed taxonomic keys were present (keys used: Schultz 1969 Morris 1973 Hoese and Moore 1977 Lindner 1978 Abbott et al. 1985 Abele and Kim 1986 Robbins et al. 1986 Kaplan 1988 Littler 1989 Kensley and Schotte 1989 Humann and DeLoach 1992 Humann and DeLoach 1994 Abbott et al. 1995 Hendler 1995 Hoese and Moore 1998 McEachran and Fechhelm 1998 Voss 2002 Pomory 2007 Mikkelsen and Bieler 2008; supplemental online resources used: http://www.algaebase.org/ http://www.fishbase.org/ http://www.gastropods.com/ http://www.itis.gov/ http://www.jaxshells.org/ http://www.marinespecies.org/ http://www.sealifebase.org/ ).In addition to fauna the catch in trawl nets often included seagrass blades and drift algae. It was important to remove animals that were attached to the seagrass and entrained in the drift algae. During the 2009 field season we did this by vigorously rinsing all plant materials in 19 liter buckets filled with seawater. The seawater was then drained through a 0.5 mm wire sieve and remaining materials which were mostly fauna mixed with sediments and plant debris were placed in a plastic bag labeled with site location. The sample was frozen and animals were identified and measured in the laboratory.The seawater rinse did well to remove most animals attached to the plant materials. This was readily confirmed by visual inspection of seagrass blades where no animals remained attached after the rinse. However we were concerned at the end of the 2009 field season that a more careful approach was needed to accurately count the number of very small arthropods and molluscs commonly associated with the drift algae. We therefore slightly altered our protocols to separate fauna from drift algae for the 2010 field season. We continued to use a vigorous seawater rinse of seagrass blades in 2010. For the drift algae we would first separate all large fauna (e.g. most fishes large crabs) leaving only the smallest arthropods and molluscs. The total volume of the drift algae captured was then measured using a calibrated 19 liter bucket. In 2009 the median volume of drift algae per tow was 15142 mL. In 2010 we collected a 3785 mL subsample of drift algae which was approximately 25% of this median value. The 3785 mL subsample was taken by haphazardly grabbing small clumps from the algae collected in the trawl. We used this haphazard selection to avoid subsampling a single small section of the algae. The entire subsample was bagged labeled frozen and taken back to the laboratory. In the laboratory the algae was first vigorously rinsed in 19 liter buckets containing seawater and remaining sample sieved as was done during the 2009 field season. The rinsed algae was then carefully inspected for the presence of remaining fauna. As suspected small arthropods and molluscs remained entrained in the algae. These animals were meticulously removed by picking each individual with forceps. Animals were then identified counted and measured. Site abundances for these subsampled animals were calculated as the number of animals counted multiplied by the percent of subsampled algae (total volume of captured drift algae / volume of subsampled drift algae).

Sampling was done primarily between the hours of 14:00 and 20:00 (during the austral summer. the illuminated period is 24 h/day) by either peristaltic pump or Kemmerer bottle. Samples were collected in 1 l bottles and preserved immediately with Lugon's solution (American Public Health Association. 1985). Identification and counts were made with an inverted microscope by the method of Utermohl (1958). At least 100 individuals of the most numerous algae were counted per sample at 100x magnification. The total number of individuals counted was dependent on the number of taxa. but ranged between 200 and 500. Counting error ranged between 13 and 26%. depending on species. Algal species identifications were made using Geitler (1932). Seaburg et al. (1979) and Prescott (1962). Cell volumes were estimated for dominant taxa by measuring cell dimensions of 50-100 individuals and using closest geometric formulas of additional dates and depths to determine changes in cell volume over time. For rare taxa. volume estimates were made from fewer cell measurements.Primary productivity was measured using the method of Strickland and Parsons (1972). In situ 24 h incubations were made in triplicate 300 ml light and duplicate 300 ml dark bottles with Na14CO3 (3 uCi per 300 ml. New England Nuclear). Following 24 h incubation. samples were well shaken and filtered through Whatman GF/F filters in the dark. The filters were placed in scintillation vials and acidified with 1 ml of 5% acetic acid in methanol to remove [C14 carbonates. The [C14] fixed by biological activity was determined in Aquasol (New England Nuclear) by liquid scintillation.Samples for nitrate and orthophosphate were frozen within several hours of collection. later filtered through 0.45 um Nucleopore filters and analyzed by air-segmented continuous-flow absorption spectrophotometry (Alpkem RFA-300) (Antweiler et al.. 1993).

For villages an almost complete absence of gardens, except for small groups of birch, poplar, willow bushes and bird cherry. Large areas occupied by kitchen gardens. All villages except Urunhayki have a semi-abandoned appearance; most of the houses and outbuildings in them in the 1970-1980-s were empty. Houses and farm outbuildings felled larch with t?sovymi roofs, stockyards, usually with a twig-thatched roofs. The first brick houses were built only in the years 1978-1980 in Urunhayke., But not widespread. Between the houses, in the former gardens and on vacant lots, there are extensive thickets nettle, hemp, burdock, goosefoot and sorrel. To the outskirts of the villages typically the presence of meadows, pastures with low herbaceous cover and clumps of bushes (spiraea, honeysuckle, wild rose). Through villages, one or two runs of the river 
or stream, like a flooded willow thickets (Urunhayka, Lower Elovka) and devoid of them. All this gives the settlements of the original shape, distinguishing them from the surrounding lanshaft, and it is characteristic of a particular, well-established in the 20th century, the species and quantity of birds.

Near the mouth of the Irkut has an open swampy floodplain, is highly productive and represents a ""splinter"" of tertiary relict steppes of the Mongolian type, greatly transformed human activity
Century (Peshkov 1972). The main complex floodplain vegetation here can distinguish waterlogged melkokochkovatye -zlakovye forb meadows, melkokochkovatye dry meadows, eutrophic lakes and the old gravel pits at different stages of overgrowth. The main type of coastal vegetation - macrophytes association with the dominance of broadleaf cattail Typha latifolia, by forming depressions and shallow waters mezhoz?rnym solid lining. In addition, there are Typha angustifolia and T. angustifolia Laxman T. laxmannii. Reed Phragmites australis grows separate clumps up to several tens of square meters in the shallow coastal waters and careers. Floodplain terraces are occupied by steppe vegetation. Dense floodplain willow (ur?ma) are located along the river and depressions extending from radially (zamytye overgrown and ducts). On the meadows there are only a few willow bushes. For plant associations characteristic of Moza, I confirm the identity to warrant a variety of habitats (Melnikov, 1995; Melnikov et al 1988, 1997a;. Lyakhov et al 1996;. Ryabtsev, Fefelov 1997).
Near the mouth of the Irkut - one of the most developed in the Baikal region, located within a large industrial center, the city of Irkutsk. The lower portion of the flood plain crossed by several railway, highways and dirt roads and numerous trails. On steep slopes and high iron and highways were formed complexes ruderal vegetation. Along the trails, and the lower portions of slopes among the vegetation is dominated by a crescent lucerne Medicago falcata, white sweet clover Melilotus albus and notched M. dentatus. The same type of vegetation characteristic of the excavation dumps along the pits, but is dominated by blue-gray Mari Chenopodium glaucum and white Ch. album. High and dense thickets provide a protective environment for nesting birds, especially waterfowl.
Bund rail and highways understand smashed into several relatively isolated areas. Career filled with water and a thicket of broad-leaved cattails, reeds, and in places with reeds Scirpus lacustris. Sharply limit the flow of water, causing waterlogging depressions, and the formation of large overgrown with cattails pl?sov. Transient complete flooding of the floodplain is extremely rare, only in years with snowfalls in winters and happy spring, and in wet years with a sharp rise of water in Irkut. During the period of our work was a gradual draining of the floodplain and the formation of a more xerophilous, ostepn?nnyh meadows.

Diurnal samples were taken in triplicate at low spring tides with the chincha a traditionally used purse-seine-type net of the region (Nobre et al. 1915) and with 2.5 m fixed-frame-opening trawl in a 1.5-min tow. The area enclosed by the chincha was approximately 1500 m s at all stations except at VAG where it was 800 m s due to the narrow topographic configuration. Fishes were preserved by freezing. At the laboratory each specimen was identified according to the taxonomic keys of Whitehead et al. (1986) measured (total length) and weighed. The abundance biomass and species richness of the ichthyofauna were determined by sampling station. Fish were collected monthly from December 1996 to November 1997 at nine selected stations (Fig. 1) near the mouth of the lagoon (BAR GAF and SJA) at the edges of the main channels (ARE CAR and VAG) in the main freshwater area highly organically enriched (RIO) in the area showing the highest levels of industrial pollution (LAR) and approximately in the middle of the longest channel (TOR).  Samples were monthly taken in triplicate at low tide with a chincha a traditional beach-seine (Fig. 2). The area enclosed by the chincha was approximately 1000 m2 at all stations except at VAG where it was 800 m 2 due to a narrow topographic configuration. Stretched mesh sizes in the chincha were 19 mm at the wings 17 mm at the cod mouth 16 mm at the cod sleeve and 10 mm at the cod-end piece. Abiotic parameters (temperature and dissolved oxygen) were recorded with an oxygen meter (CONSORT Z621) salinity was recorded with a refractometer (ATAGO) and water transparency was estimated based on turbidity and Secchi depth according to Yanez-Arancibia et al. 1983 (in Rebelo 1992). Fishes were preserved by freezing. At the laboratory each specimen was identified according to the taxonomic keys of Bauchot and Pras (1987) and  Whitehead et al. (1986) measured (total length) and weighed (total weight). The abundance biomass and species richness of the ichthyofauna were determined by sampling station.  Fish were sampled monthly between November 1998 and November 2000 with a chincha a traditional beach-seine net. At each site and month three replicate samples were taken at low tide during the 5 days of the new moon at adjacent non-overlapping areas at nine sites. These sites strategically covered all the lagoon area and are designated as BAR GAF and SJA (near the mouth of the lagoon) ARE CAR and VAG (at the edges of the main channels) RIO (in the main freshwater area highly organically enriched) LAR (in the area showing the highest levels of industrial pollution) and TOR (approximately in the middle of the longest channel) (Fig. 1). The chincha gear used was almost rectangular in shape and composed by a central bag (a cod-end 295 cm of length and 145 cm of wide) two lateral wings (12 m of length each the width decreasing along the net reaching 50 cm at the edge and a central height of 1.5 m) two ropes (6.1 m each) and ?oating buoys at the top and ceramic weights at the bottom of the net. The end of the net was ?xed to the margin and the remainder was trawled in a semi-circle thus retaining within the cod-end all the ?sh from the area. The total area enclosed by the gear was estimated calculating the area of the semicircle of the lateral wings (93.6 m2) plus the area of the semi-circle of the cod-end (5.6 m2) plus the area of the rectangle formed by the two ropes (94.2 m2). The area of the whole net was approximately 193 m2 in each trawl. The net ef?ciency is estimated at 90percent based on continued observations of ?sh escaping above or behind the net. Fishes were preserved by freezing and they were identi?ed using taxonomic keys of Whitehead et al. (1986) and Bauchot and Pras (1987).

Although these reefs are fished, the physical isolation of the island means that they receive less impact from human activities than most reefs in Southern California, making San Nicolas an ideal place to evaluate alternative theories about the dynamics of these communities. Here we present monitoring data from seven sampling stations surrounding the island, including data on fish, invertebrate and algal abundance. These data are unusual among subtidal monitoring datasets in that they combine relatively frequent sampling (twice per year) with an exceptionally long time series (since 1980). Other outstanding qualities of the dataset are the high taxonomic resolution captured and the monitoring of permanent quadrats and swaths where the history of the community structure at specific locations has been recorded through time. Finally, the data span a period that includes two of the strongest ENSO events on record, a major shift in the Pacific decadal oscillation and the reintroduction of sea otters to the island in 1987 after at least 150 years of absence. These events provide opportunities to evaluate the effects of bottom up forcing, top down control and physical disturbance on shallow rocky reef communities.do not include references in the abstract.

Here, we present data on temperate subtidal reef communities at 33 sites, almost half of which the National Park Service has sampled annually since 1982.   We present core data sets describing the population dynamics of 16 fish, 37 invertebrate, and 15 algal taxa.  We include supplementary data sets documenting the size structure of key species, the relative abundance of all fish, the recruitment of selected invertebrates, and the subtidal water temperature at each site through time.

In particular, fire may increase grass and forb production while hindering shrub encroachment. Therefore, prescribed fires are a common management tool for maintaining grassland habitats in the southwest. However, Bouteloua eriopoda (black grama), a dominant species in Chihuahuan Desert grassland, is highly susceptible to fire resulting in death followed by slow recovery rates. A prescribed fire on the Sevilleta National Wildlife refuge in central New Mexico in 2003 provided the opportunity to study the effects of infrequent fires on vegetation in this region. This study was conducted along a transition zone where creosote bushes (Larrea tridentata) are encroaching on a black grama grassland. Before and after the fire, above ground plant productivity and composition were monitored from 2003 to present. Following the prescribed fire, there were fewer individual grass clumps and less above ground grass cover in burned areas compared to unburned areas. This decrease in productivity was primarily from a loss of B. eriopoda. Specifically, B. eriopoda density and cover were significantly lower following the fire with a slow recovery rate in the five years following the fire. Other grasses showed no such adverse response to burning.

Individual plants in these quadrats were identified and mapped annually from 1932 through 1945. Quadrats were located in six pastures assigned to cattle grazing treatments with light, moderate, and heavy stocking rates of 1.24, 0.92, and 0.76 ha/ animal-unit-month (two pastures in each). These data provide unique opportunities to test the interactive effects of grazing and climate variables on demographic rates, plantplant interactions, and population and community dynamics. We provide the following data and data formats: (1) the digitized maps in shapefile format; (2) a tabular version of the entire data set (a table that replaces the full spatial data with one x,y coordinate for each individual perennial plant record); (3) grazing treatment information; (4) an inventory of the years each quadrat was sampled; (5) a species list, containing information on plant growth forms and shapefile geometry type (e.g., points or polygons); (6) a record of changes in species names; (7) daily precipitation and temperature records; and (8) counts of annual plants in the quadrats (annuals were counted, not mapped, by the original mappers).Experimental or sampling design
a. Design characteristics: 44 permanent quadrats were located in 6 different pasture units.
b. Permanent plots: We have not been able to relocate the original quadrats because of a lack of permanent markers.
c. Data collection: Quadrats were mapped annually from 1932 to 1945, with some exceptions (see the quadrat sampling schedule data file in IV). Quadrats were mapped in the late spring-early summer growing season each year (generally between late May and July).
Research Methods 
a. Field / laboratory: The data were collected in the field using pantographs (Hill 1920), a mechanical device used to make scale drawings. The original paper maps were first scanned and then stored as TIFF image files. These images were then converted into shapefiles by heads-up digitization in ArcGIS. For a complete digitization protocol, contact Peter Adler. Daily climate data were obtained from the Miles City airport, Wiley Field (800 m a.s.l., 4626N, 10553W) located 9 km north of the study site. For the period beginning in 1933, these data are available on-line from the National Climate Data Center at www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwDI~StnSrch~StnID~20012408.
b. Instrumentation: Pantographs, scanners, and computers running ArcGIS, Python, and R.
c. Taxonomy and systematics: Originally assigned plant names were corrected for synonyms based on the USDA Plants Database (http://plants.usda.gov/). We recorded these name changes in the species_name_changes.csv file.

The position of the individual singing males were plotted on a gridded census map and great care was taken in mapping simultaneously singing neighbours.  In addition, other territorial behaviour such as courtship feeding, nest building behaviour and copulation was used to delimit the individual territories.  Considerable time was spent in searching for nests.  Mapping of colourringed individuals was also used to determine the number of territories involved.  Each year 13 - 20 census visits were made of which about two thirds took place during the mornings.  Each visit lasted about 5 to 5.5 hours and was started alternatively from the eastern and western parts of the area.  the census work was coarried out from the last week of May to the end of June.  Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney U-tests Spearman rank correlation (rn where the subscript n denotes df).  All tests were two tailed.

The top species was recorded at each location and the species at the ground surface was recorded if it was different from the top species.

Grazing pressure had declined, sward height increased, extent of bare ground declined, cover of vascular plants increased and cover of crytogams declined. Overall vegetation change was from a heathland towards a grassland. The vegetation change was related to declining livestock numbers and grazing pressure, but not the less to a warming climatic trend during the period.

These surveys took place onboard trawlers fishing the Israeli continental shelf, between latitudes 3120 N and 3305 N. Depths ranged between 15 and 300 m. The gross, discarded and landed catch weights were estimated for 173 out of the 324 hauls in which two or more of these variables were recorded, and therefore total catch analysis was possible. A sample of ca. 5% of the biomass (2.7-12.5 kg with a mean of 5.52.4 kg per haul) was extracted from each haul. While this partial-sampling method may miss rare species, it allows nearly all the fauna in the nets to be properly sampled and the time-consuming length measurements to be carried out onboard. Fish were taxonomically identified to species level, except for several cases in which only the genus was noted. Fish Total Length (TL), cephalopod Mantle Length (ML) and crustacean Carapace Length (CL for crabs, eye to telson length for shrimps) were measured to the closest 0.5 cm interval. The discard lengths defined in the present study are described in Table 1 and were subsequently used to differentiate between the two discarded fractions: non-commercial species and juveniles of commercial species. These lengths were determined empirically, i.e. they were estimated based on observations of onboard sorting practices, fishermens experience and minimum landing size (MLS),rather than on the actual onboard sorting of specimens, which may vary considerably due to factors such asseason, abundance, and market considerations (Machiaset al., 2001, Demestre et al., 2008). The catch sampling protocol from 1990 to 1994 was repeated in 20082011. A representative sub-sample from the total catch was obtained from the fish pile onboard with no specific preference given to any direction on deck to assure randomness. All fishes in samples were taxonomically identified to the species level and measured to the nearest 0.5 cm. 19901994 data were collected by several surveyors, and hauls with a clear lower taxonomic resolution were subsequently omitted from the database.

Historical and modern catch data of Israeli trawlers were used to evaluate trends in abundance, biomass, diversity and TrL of Levantine fishes, and assess potential interactions between invasive and indigenous species. Historical data were collected from 267 trawl hauls from April 1990 to December 1994 at depths of 15300 m. Current data were collected in 183 hauls conducted between October 2008 and March 2011, covering the same fishing fields and depth range (15300 m) on the continental shelf and upper slope.

Plots which had been initially established by Rudolf Hundt had been revisited in the 1970ies by him together with diploma students (Husler 1979, Prizckat 1984, Teichfischer 1984). Vegetation records were made, using the Braun-Blanquet scale. For data were harmonized according to the German SL standard checklist for plant species, entered into the German Reference Vegetation Database (Jandt & Bruelheide 2012) and exported for Biotime with per cent cover values. Geographic coordinates were assigned to the most probable position by Ute Jandt.

At each island and mainland site, bats were sampled in a standardized manner with mist nets (6  2.5 m, 70/2 denier, 16-mm mesh size, five shelves) set along the perimeter of plots of c. 0.5 ha (typically 100  50 m; one plot per site). Each site was sampled for 78 complete nights over the 2-year period, with a minimum time interval of 30 days between netting nights. All sites were sampled with equal effort during all moon phases, and we generally avoided netting immediately before and after a full moon in order to minimize potential bias in capture success as a result of lunar-phobic behaviour (e.g. Morrison, 1978). During each survey night, we used six nets
erected at ground level and spaced c. 50 m apart. In order also to sample bats flying in higher forest strata, we set up a net wall, typically consisting of four stacked nets, reaching subcanopy
(mainland sites) or canopy (islands) level. Canopy height across study sites averaged < 20 m and was often < 15 m on islands. Species were identified, and standard measurements and demographic data were collected following Handley et al. (1991). Nomenclature follows Simmons (2005). Most bats (species > 10 g, excluding juveniles) were marked with individually numbered ball-chain necklaces, or, in the case of larger gleaning animalivores, with passive, subcutaneous transponders (EURO-ID, Weilerswist, Germany). Based on the classification system used by several
authors (Stevens & Willig, 2000; Patterson et al., 2003; Giannini & Kalko, 2004, 2005), we assigned bats to one of the following ensembles (Fauth et al., 1996): frugivores, gleaning
animalivores, nectarivores, omnivores, and sanguivores. For further detail please see associated papers as cited.",Mist-nets,,Abundance calculated as bats/effort as per associated paper.

For each site, we assessed vegetation structure (local-scale variable) and, for five focal scales, quantified habitat amount and four landscape configuration metrics. Each sampling site was visited eight times over a 2-year period, between August 2011 and June 2013. Bats were captured using 14 ground-level mist nets (12 9 2.5 m, 16 mm mesh, ECOTONE, Poland) in CF and fragment interiors, and seven ground-level mist nets at the edge and matrix sites. Mist nets were deployed along existing trails which are known to be used by Neotropical bats as commuting flyways (Palmeirim and Etheridge 1985). At edge sites, these trails ran parallel to the border between primary forest and secondary regrowth. In our study area mist netting efficiency was found to be highest in the first few hours after sunset (Bernard 2002). Sampling therefore started at dusk and was performed for 6 h during which nets were visited at intervals of*20 min. Mist netting at the same location for consecutive days can lead to diminishing capture efficiency over time (Marques et al. 2013). Such net-shyness related bias was avoided by spacing visits to the same site 34 weeks apart. Species were identified following Gardner (2007) and Lim and Engstrom (2010), and taxonomy follows Gardner (2007). Most adult bats were marked with individually numbered ball-chain necklaces (frugivores and Pteronotus parnellii) or subcutaneous transponders (gleaning animalivores). We restricted analyses to phyllostomids and P. parnellii, since all other species in Neotropical bat assemblages are known to be inadequately sampled with mist-nets (Kalko 1998).
