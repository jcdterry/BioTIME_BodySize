**Extended Data Figure 1** Significance of trait-trend correlation ($\tau$) for each trait-study combination. Within each study, the trait values (including NAs) were randomised 10000 times, and the Kendall rank-correlation recalculated to generate a reference distribution. Black lines show 95% and 66% intervals, dots show observed values. Individual studies were coloured if $\tau$ fell outside the central 95%.

# Study-level Predictors - Figure 2, Table 1, Table 2



![](../Plots/TauPredictorsPlot.png)
**Extended Data Figure 2** No consistent relationships between the suite of study-level predictors and the principal response variable $\tau$. Statistical results are given in Extended Data Tables 2 and 3. 


\newpage


**Extended Data Table 1** Full statistical results from linear model analysis of putative study-level drivers of $\tau$. Each trait (apart from `Qualitative body size', for which there were too few studies for a meaningful test) was tested independently and no corrections were made to the reported values for multiple comparisons. There was no consistent drivers - while certain relationships were identified as significant at p<0.05 (highlighted in **bold**), these were not consistent across traits and had low explanatory power (adjusted-$R^2$) in all cases except Fish (as discussed in the main text).

# Species Level Analysis - Figure 3, Table 3, Table 4

```{r}
include_graphics(path = "../Plots/SpeciesLevelPlots.pdf")
```

**Extended Data Figure 3** Species level likelihood that a populations trend is identifiable as a 'winner' or 'loser' based on the sign and significance (p<0.1) of a regression line of the transformed abundance against time. Compared to the analysis in the main text (which effectively weights each study equally), this analysis weights each species in each study equally. Species from across the whole dataset are binned along the x-axis by their relative trait value within their assemblage. Because the 'Qualitative Body Size' trait has only a limited number of categories, some relative trait ranks did not occur. Where a species is observed in multiple assemblages within a study, the contribution of each time series is downweighted so that each species contributes equally for each study it is in. 


**Extended Data Table 3** Total counts of the number of species in each category for each trait. Species that are found in multiple studies are counted each time. Where species have different trends in different cells within a study they are assigned fractionally. For example, a species that was observed in 10 assemblages within a study, and was observed to be a 'winner' in two and 'no clear trend' in eight is counted as 0.2 of a winner and 0.8 of no trend. 

```{r}

WinLossAll <- read_csv('../SIdata/WinLossAll.csv')  

WinLossAll %>%
  ungroup %>%
  count(trait, WinLoss, wt = weight) %>%
  spread(WinLoss, n) %>%
  mutate( trait = recode(trait , "TR_BodyLength_mm"="Marine:  Body Length",
                         "TR_QualBS_Numeric" = "Marine: Qualitative Body Size" ,
                         "TR_Mean_LengthMax"= "Fish: Maximum Length", 
                         "TR_adult_body_mass_g"= "Amniotes: Adult body mass",
                         "TR_Mean_SeedMass"="Plants: Seed Mass",
                         "TR_Max_Height"="Plants: Maximum Height"  )) %>%
  rename(Trait = trait) %>%
  kable(digits = 1)

```


**Extended Data Table 4** Statistical results demonstrating the lack of a significant relationship between the relative trait rank within an assemblage and the assignment to either 'winner' or 'loser' categories. Each test was a logistic regression, weighted by the reciprocal of the number of cells within a study that include the species. Coefficient estimates are shown on the transformed scale. Separate models were fit for each trait and direction of trend, and no corrections were made for multiple comparisons.

# Comparison of Transformations - Figure 4, Figure 5

![](../Plots/CrossTrans_CorInSlopes.png)


**Extended Data Figure 4** Strong correlation between all trend slopes ($\beta$'s) calculated using alternative population data transformations. Transformation A is that presented in the main text results, Transformation B is the standardisation by dividing by the mean population values, and Transformation C is the rank based approach.   Correlations shown are Pearson's correlation coefficients.   



```{r}
include_graphics(path = "../Plots/ComparisonDotplots.pdf")
```


**Extended Data Figure 5** Strong concordance of overall results  under different data transformations. Figure elements are the same as in the main text Figure 2. The red dotted line shows the mean $\tau$ value in each facet. All three transformations show the same pattern of trait-level significance - the only guild where a significant (positive) deviation from the null distribution (bar under histograms) is detectable is the amniotes.

# Overlap in Trait Data - Figure 6

**Extended Data Figure 6** Further details of degree of overlap and correspondence between traits. a) Number of species that could be related to at least one trait from the four sources. b) Overlap within the WoRMS database between the quantitative and qualitative body lengths was relatively low. In cases where the data was available on both categories, the Spearman's rank correlation was 0.65. c) Very strong correlation between the size traits for species that had data in both the WoRMS and the FishBase databases. d) Overlap in trait data between then plant species held in the TRY database was comparatively high. e) Correlation between the seed mass and vegetative height trait values was moderate, and considerably less within guilds.

# List of Studies - Table 6

**Extended Data Table 6** - List of studies used from BioTIME, including key statistics and description. Studies are ordered by trait, then by $\tau$. If a study could be linked to multiple traits, it will therefore appear multiple times.  Note this table is also available in .csv format (`Study_Corr_Predictors.csv`) with the code supplement. ID numbers correspond to the BioTIME database, and columns 'Latitude' to 'Data Source' are directly drawn from the BioTIME metadata. Further metadata (including descriptions of original sampling methods) are available from the original BioTIME metadata sources.
